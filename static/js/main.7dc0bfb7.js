The English have no respect for\ntheir language, and will not teach their children to speak it. They\nspell it so abominably that no man can teach himself what it sounds\nlike. It is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without\nmaking some other Englishman hate or despise him. German and Spanish\nare accessible to foreigners: English is not accessible even to\nEnglishmen. The reformer England needs today is an energetic phonetic\nenthusiast: that is why I have made such a one the hero of a popular\nplay. There have been heroes of that kind crying in the wilderness for\nmany years past. When I became interested in the subject towards the\nend of the eighteen-seventies, Melville Bell was dead; but Alexander J.\nEllis was still a living patriarch, with an impressive head always\ncovered by a velvet skull cap, for which he would apologize to public\nmeetings in a very courtly manner. He and Tito Pagliardini, another\nphonetic veteran, were men whom it was impossible to dislike. Henry\nSweet, then a young man, lacked their sweetness of character: he was\nabout as conciliatory to conventional mortals as Ibsen or Samuel\nButler. His great ability as a phonetician (he was, I think, the best\nof them all at his job) would have entitled him to high official\nrecognition, and perhaps enabled him to popularize his subject, but for\nhis Satanic contempt for all academic dignitaries and persons in\ngeneral who thought more of Greek than of phonetics. Once, in the days\nwhen the Imperial Institute rose in South Kensington, and Joseph\nChamberlain was booming the Empire, I induced the editor of a leading\nmonthly review to commission an article from Sweet on the imperial\nimportance of his subject. When it arrived, it contained nothing but a\nsavagely derisive attack on a professor of language and literature\nwhose chair Sweet regarded as proper to a phonetic expert only. The\narticle, being libelous, had to be returned as impossible; and I had to\nrenounce my dream of dragging its author into the limelight. When I met\nhim afterwards, for the first time for many years, I found to my\nastonishment that he, who had been a quite tolerably presentable young\nman, had actually managed by sheer scorn to alter his personal\nappearance until he had become a sort of walking repudiation of Oxford\nand all its traditions. It must have been largely in his own despite\nthat he was squeezed into something called a Readership of phonetics\nthere. The future of phonetics rests probably with his pupils, who all\nswore by him; but nothing could bring the man himself into any sort of\ncompliance with the university, to which he nevertheless clung by\ndivine right in an intensely Oxonian way. I daresay his papers, if he\nhas left any, include some satires that may be published without too\ndestructive results fifty years hence. He was, I believe, not in the\nleast an ill-natured man: very much the opposite, I should say; but he\nwould not suffer fools gladly.\n\nThose who knew him will recognize in my third act the allusion to the\npatent Shorthand in which he used to write postcards, and which may be\nacquired from a four and six-penny manual published by the Clarendon\nPress. The postcards which Mrs. Higgins describes are such as I have\nreceived from Sweet. I would decipher a sound which a cockney would\nrepresent by zerr, and a Frenchman by seu, and then write demanding\nwith some heat what on earth it meant. Sweet, with boundless contempt\nfor my stupidity, would reply that it not only meant but obviously was\nthe word Result, as no other Word containing that sound, and capable of\nmaking sense with the context, existed in any language spoken on earth.\nThat less expert mortals should require fuller indications was beyond\nSweet\u2019s patience. Therefore, though the whole point of his \u201cCurrent\nShorthand\u201d is that it can express every sound in the language\nperfectly, vowels as well as consonants, and that your hand has to make\nno stroke except the easy and current ones with which you write m, n,\nand u, l, p, and q, scribbling them at whatever angle comes easiest to\nyou, his unfortunate determination to make this remarkable and quite\nlegible script serve also as a Shorthand reduced it in his own practice\nto the most inscrutable of cryptograms. His true objective was the\nprovision of a full, accurate, legible script for our noble but\nill-dressed language; but he was led past that by his contempt for the\npopular Pitman system of Shorthand, which he called the Pitfall system.\nThe triumph of Pitman was a triumph of business organization: there was\na weekly paper to persuade you to learn Pitman: there were cheap\ntextbooks and exercise books and transcripts of speeches for you to\ncopy, and schools where experienced teachers coached you up to the\nnecessary proficiency. Sweet could not organize his market in that\nfashion. He might as well have been the Sybil who tore up the leaves of\nprophecy that nobody would attend to. The four and six-penny manual,\nmostly in his lithographed handwriting, that was never vulgarly\nadvertized, may perhaps some day be taken up by a syndicate and pushed\nupon the public as The Times pushed the Encyclopaedia Britannica; but\nuntil then it will certainly not prevail against Pitman. I have bought\nthree copies of it during my lifetime; and I am informed by the\npublishers that its cloistered existence is still a steady and healthy\none. I actually learned the system two several times; and yet the\nshorthand in which I am writing these lines is Pitman\u2019s. And the reason\nis, that my secretary cannot transcribe Sweet, having been perforce\ntaught in the schools of Pitman. Therefore, Sweet railed at Pitman as\nvainly as Thersites railed at Ajax: his raillery, however it may have\neased his soul, gave no popular vogue to Current Shorthand. Pygmalion\nHiggins is not a portrait of Sweet, to whom the adventure of Eliza\nDoolittle would have been impossible; still, as will be seen, there are\ntouches of Sweet in the play. With Higgins\u2019s physique and temperament\nSweet might have set the Thames on fire. As it was, he impressed\nhimself professionally on Europe to an extent that made his comparative\npersonal obscurity, and the failure of Oxford to do justice to his\neminence, a puzzle to foreign specialists in his subject. I do not\nblame Oxford, because I think Oxford is quite right in demanding a\ncertain social amenity from its nurslings (heaven knows it is not\nexorbitant in its requirements!); for although I well know how hard it\nis for a man of genius with a seriously underrated subject to maintain\nserene and kindly relations with the men who underrate it, and who keep\nall the best places for less important subjects which they profess\nwithout originality and sometimes without much capacity for them,\nstill, if he overwhelms them with wrath and disdain, he cannot expect\nthem to heap honors on him.\n\nOf the later generations of phoneticians I know little. Among them\ntowers the Poet Laureate, to whom perhaps Higgins may owe his Miltonic\nsympathies, though here again I must disclaim all portraiture. But if\nthe play makes the public aware that there are such people as\nphoneticians, and that they are among the most important people in\nEngland at present, it will serve its turn.\n\nI wish to boast that Pygmalion has been an extremely successful play\nall over Europe and North America as well as at home. It is so\nintensely and deliberately didactic, and its subject is esteemed so\ndry, that I delight in throwing it at the heads of the wiseacres who\nrepeat the parrot cry that art should never be didactic. It goes to\nprove my contention that art should never be anything else.\n\nFinally, and for the encouragement of people troubled with accents that\ncut them off from all high employment, I may add that the change\nwrought by Professor Higgins in the flower girl is neither impossible\nnor uncommon. The modern concierge\u2019s daughter who fulfils her ambition\nby playing the Queen of Spain in Ruy Blas at the Theatre Francais is\nonly one of many thousands of men and women who have sloughed off their\nnative dialects and acquired a new tongue. But the thing has to be done\nscientifically, or the last state of the aspirant may be worse than the\nfirst. An honest and natural slum dialect is more tolerable than the\nattempt of a phonetically untaught person to imitate the vulgar dialect\nof the golf club; and I am sorry to say that in spite of the efforts of\nour Academy of Dramatic Art, there is still too much sham golfing\nEnglish on our stage, and too little of the noble English of Forbes\nRobertson.\n\n\n\n\nACT I\n\n\nCovent Garden at 11.15 p.m. Torrents of heavy summer rain. Cab whistles\nblowing frantically in all directions. Pedestrians running for shelter\ninto the market and under the portico of St. Paul\u2019s Church, where there\nare already several people, among them a lady and her daughter in\nevening dress. They are all peering out gloomily at the rain, except\none man with his back turned to the rest, who seems wholly preoccupied\nwith a notebook in which he is writing busily.\n\nThe church clock strikes the first quarter.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER [in the space between the central pillars, close to the\none on her left] I\u2019m getting chilled to the bone. What can Freddy be\ndoing all this time? He\u2019s been gone twenty minutes.\n\nTHE MOTHER [on her daughter\u2019s right] Not so long. But he ought to have\ngot us a cab by this.\n\nA BYSTANDER [on the lady\u2019s right] He won\u2019t get no cab not until\nhalf-past eleven, missus, when they come back after dropping their\ntheatre fares.\n\nTHE MOTHER. But we must have a cab. We can\u2019t stand here until half-past\neleven. It\u2019s too bad.\n\nTHE BYSTANDER. Well, it ain\u2019t my fault, missus.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. If Freddy had a bit of gumption, he would have got one at\nthe theatre door.\n\nTHE MOTHER. What could he have done, poor boy?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Other people got cabs. Why couldn\u2019t he?\n\nFreddy rushes in out of the rain from the Southampton Street side, and\ncomes between them closing a dripping umbrella. He is a young man of\ntwenty, in evening dress, very wet around the ankles.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Well, haven\u2019t you got a cab?\n\nFREDDY. There\u2019s not one to be had for love or money.\n\nTHE MOTHER. Oh, Freddy, there must be one. You can\u2019t have tried.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. It\u2019s too tiresome. Do you expect us to go and get one\nourselves?\n\nFREDDY. I tell you they\u2019re all engaged. The rain was so sudden: nobody\nwas prepared; and everybody had to take a cab. I\u2019ve been to Charing\nCross one way and nearly to Ludgate Circus the other; and they were all\nengaged.\n\nTHE MOTHER. Did you try Trafalgar Square?\n\nFREDDY. There wasn\u2019t one at Trafalgar Square.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Did you try?\n\nFREDDY. I tried as far as Charing Cross Station. Did you expect me to\nwalk to Hammersmith?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. You haven\u2019t tried at all.\n\nTHE MOTHER. You really are very helpless, Freddy. Go again; and don\u2019t\ncome back until you have found a cab.\n\nFREDDY. I shall simply get soaked for nothing.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And what about us? Are we to stay here all night in this\ndraught, with next to nothing on. You selfish pig\u2014\n\nFREDDY. Oh, very well: I\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll go. [He opens his umbrella and\ndashes off Strandwards, but comes into collision with a flower girl,\nwho is hurrying in for shelter, knocking her basket out of her hands. A\nblinding flash of lightning, followed instantly by a rattling peal of\nthunder, orchestrates the incident]\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Nah then, Freddy: look wh\u2019 y\u2019 gowin, deah.\n\nFREDDY. Sorry [he rushes off].\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [picking up her scattered flowers and replacing them in\nthe basket] There\u2019s menners f\u2019 yer! Te-oo banches o voylets trod into\nthe mad. [She sits down on the plinth of the column, sorting her\nflowers, on the lady\u2019s right. She is not at all an attractive person.\nShe is perhaps eighteen, perhaps twenty, hardly older. She wears a\nlittle sailor hat of black straw that has long been exposed to the dust\nand soot of London and has seldom if ever been brushed. Her hair needs\nwashing rather badly: its mousy color can hardly be natural. She wears\na shoddy black coat that reaches nearly to her knees and is shaped to\nher waist. She has a brown skirt with a coarse apron. Her boots are\nmuch the worse for wear. She is no doubt as clean as she can afford to\nbe; but compared to the ladies she is very dirty. Her features are no\nworse than theirs; but their condition leaves something to be desired;\nand she needs the services of a dentist].\n\nTHE MOTHER. How do you know that my son\u2019s name is Freddy, pray?\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Ow, eez ye-ooa san, is e? Wal, fewd dan y\u2019 de-ooty\nbawmz a mather should, eed now bettern to spawl a pore gel\u2019s flahrzn\nthan ran awy atbaht pyin. Will ye-oo py me f\u2019them? [Here, with\napologies, this desperate attempt to represent her dialect without a\nphonetic alphabet must be abandoned as unintelligible outside London.]\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Do nothing of the sort, mother. The idea!\n\nTHE MOTHER. Please allow me, Clara. Have you any pennies?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. No. I\u2019ve nothing smaller than sixpence.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [hopefully] I can give you change for a tanner, kind\nlady.\n\nTHE MOTHER [to Clara] Give it to me. [Clara parts reluctantly]. Now [to\nthe girl] This is for your flowers.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Thank you kindly, lady.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Make her give you the change. These things are only a\npenny a bunch.\n\nTHE MOTHER. Do hold your tongue, Clara. [To the girl]. You can keep the\nchange.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Oh, thank you, lady.\n\nTHE MOTHER. Now tell me how you know that young gentleman\u2019s name.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. I didn\u2019t.\n\nTHE MOTHER. I heard you call him by it. Don\u2019t try to deceive me.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [protesting] Who\u2019s trying to deceive you? I called him\nFreddy or Charlie same as you might yourself if you was talking to a\nstranger and wished to be pleasant. [She sits down beside her basket].\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Sixpence thrown away! Really, mamma, you might have\nspared Freddy that. [She retreats in disgust behind the pillar].\n\nAn elderly gentleman of the amiable military type rushes into shelter,\nand closes a dripping umbrella. He is in the same plight as Freddy,\nvery wet about the ankles. He is in evening dress, with a light\novercoat. He takes the place left vacant by the daughter\u2019s retirement.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. Phew!\n\nTHE MOTHER [to the gentleman] Oh, sir, is there any sign of its\nstopping?\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. I\u2019m afraid not. It started worse than ever about two\nminutes ago. [He goes to the plinth beside the flower girl; puts up his\nfoot on it; and stoops to turn down his trouser ends].\n\nTHE MOTHER. Oh, dear! [She retires sadly and joins her daughter].\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [taking advantage of the military gentleman\u2019s proximity\nto establish friendly relations with him]. If it\u2019s worse it\u2019s a sign\nit\u2019s nearly over. So cheer up, Captain; and buy a flower off a poor\ngirl.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. I\u2019m sorry, I haven\u2019t any change.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. I can give you change, Captain,\n\nTHE GENTLEMEN. For a sovereign? I\u2019ve nothing less.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Garn! Oh do buy a flower off me, Captain. I can change\nhalf-a-crown. Take this for tuppence.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. Now don\u2019t be troublesome: there\u2019s a good girl. [Trying\nhis pockets] I really haven\u2019t any change\u2014Stop: here\u2019s three hapence,\nif that\u2019s any use to you [he retreats to the other pillar].\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [disappointed, but thinking three halfpence better than\nnothing] Thank you, sir.\n\nTHE BYSTANDER [to the girl] You be careful: give him a flower for it.\nThere\u2019s a bloke here behind taking down every blessed word you\u2019re\nsaying. [All turn to the man who is taking notes].\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [springing up terrified] I ain\u2019t done nothing wrong by\nspeaking to the gentleman. I\u2019ve a right to sell flowers if I keep off\nthe kerb. [Hysterically] I\u2019m a respectable girl: so help me, I never\nspoke to him except to ask him to buy a flower off me. [General hubbub,\nmostly sympathetic to the flower girl, but deprecating her excessive\nsensibility. Cries of Don\u2019t start hollerin. Who\u2019s hurting you? Nobody\u2019s\ngoing to touch you. What\u2019s the good of fussing? Steady on. Easy, easy,\netc., come from the elderly staid spectators, who pat her comfortingly.\nLess patient ones bid her shut her head, or ask her roughly what is\nwrong with her. A remoter group, not knowing what the matter is, crowd\nin and increase the noise with question and answer: What\u2019s the row?\nWhat she do? Where is he? A tec taking her down. What! him? Yes: him\nover there: Took money off the gentleman, etc. The flower girl,\ndistraught and mobbed, breaks through them to the gentleman, crying\nmildly] Oh, sir, don\u2019t let him charge me. You dunno what it means to\nme. They\u2019ll take away my character and drive me on the streets for\nspeaking to gentlemen. They\u2014\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER [coming forward on her right, the rest crowding after\nhim] There, there, there, there! Who\u2019s hurting you, you silly girl?\nWhat do you take me for?\n\nTHE BYSTANDER. It\u2019s all right: he\u2019s a gentleman: look at his boots.\n[Explaining to the note taker] She thought you was a copper\u2019s nark, sir.\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER [with quick interest] What\u2019s a copper\u2019s nark?\n\nTHE BYSTANDER [inept at definition] It\u2019s a\u2014well, it\u2019s a copper\u2019s nark,\nas you might say. What else would you call it? A sort of informer.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [still hysterical] I take my Bible oath I never said a\nword\u2014\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER [overbearing but good-humored] Oh, shut up, shut up. Do\nI look like a policeman?\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [far from reassured] Then what did you take down my\nwords for? How do I know whether you took me down right? You just show\nme what you\u2019ve wrote about me. [The note taker opens his book and holds\nit steadily under her nose, though the pressure of the mob trying to\nread it over his shoulders would upset a weaker man]. What\u2019s that? That\nain\u2019t proper writing. I can\u2019t read that.\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER. I can. [Reads, reproducing her pronunciation exactly]\n\u201cCheer ap, Keptin; n\u2019 haw ya flahr orf a pore gel.\u201d\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [much distressed] It\u2019s because I called him Captain. I\nmeant no harm. [To the gentleman] Oh, sir, don\u2019t let him lay a charge\nagen me for a word like that. You\u2014\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. Charge! I make no charge. [To the note taker] Really,\nsir, if you are a detective, you need not begin protecting me against\nmolestation by young women until I ask you. Anybody could see that the\ngirl meant no harm.\n\nTHE BYSTANDERS GENERALLY [demonstrating against police espionage]\nCourse they could. What business is it of yours? You mind your own\naffairs. He wants promotion, he does. Taking down people\u2019s words! Girl\nnever said a word to him. What harm if she did? Nice thing a girl can\u2019t\nshelter from the rain without being insulted, etc., etc., etc. [She is\nconducted by the more sympathetic demonstrators back to her plinth,\nwhere she resumes her seat and struggles with her emotion].\n\nTHE BYSTANDER. He ain\u2019t a tec. He\u2019s a blooming busybody: that\u2019s what he\nis. I tell you, look at his boots.\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER [turning on him genially] And how are all your people\ndown at Selsey?\n\nTHE BYSTANDER [suspiciously] Who told you my people come from Selsey?\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER. Never you mind. They did. [To the girl] How do you come\nto be up so far east? You were born in Lisson Grove.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [appalled] Oh, what harm is there in my leaving Lisson\nGrove? It wasn\u2019t fit for a pig to live in; and I had to pay\nfour-and-six a week. [In tears] Oh, boo\u2014hoo\u2014oo\u2014\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER. Live where you like; but stop that noise.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN [to the girl] Come, come! he can\u2019t touch you: you have a\nright to live where you please.\n\nA SARCASTIC BYSTANDER [thrusting himself between the note taker and the\ngentleman] Park Lane, for instance. I\u2019d like to go into the Housing\nQuestion with you, I would.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [subsiding into a brooding melancholy over her basket,\nand talking very low-spiritedly to herself] I\u2019m a good girl, I am.\n\nTHE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER [not attending to her] Do you know where _I_\ncome from?\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER [promptly] Hoxton.\n\nTitterings. Popular interest in the note taker\u2019s performance increases.\n\nTHE SARCASTIC ONE [amazed] Well, who said I didn\u2019t? Bly me! You know\neverything, you do.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [still nursing her sense of injury] Ain\u2019t no call to\nmeddle with me, he ain\u2019t.\n\nTHE BYSTANDER [to her] Of course he ain\u2019t. Don\u2019t you stand it from him.\n[To the note taker] See here: what call have you to know about people\nwhat never offered to meddle with you? Where\u2019s your warrant?\n\nSEVERAL BYSTANDERS [encouraged by this seeming point of law] Yes:\nwhere\u2019s your warrant?\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Let him say what he likes. I don\u2019t want to have no\ntruck with him.\n\nTHE BYSTANDER. You take us for dirt under your feet, don\u2019t you? Catch\nyou taking liberties with a gentleman!\n\nTHE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER. Yes: tell HIM where he come from if you want\nto go fortune-telling.\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER. Cheltenham, Harrow, Cambridge, and India.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. Quite right. [Great laughter. Reaction in the note\ntaker\u2019s favor. Exclamations of He knows all about it. Told him proper.\nHear him tell the toff where he come from? etc.]. May I ask, sir, do\nyou do this for your living at a music hall?\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER. I\u2019ve thought of that. Perhaps I shall some day.\n\nThe rain has stopped; and the persons on the outside of the crowd begin\nto drop off.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [resenting the reaction] He\u2019s no gentleman, he ain\u2019t,\nto interfere with a poor girl.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER [out of patience, pushing her way rudely to the front and\ndisplacing the gentleman, who politely retires to the other side of the\npillar] What on earth is Freddy doing? I shall get pneumonia if I stay\nin this draught any longer.\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER [to himself, hastily making a note of her pronunciation\nof \u201cmonia\u201d] Earlscourt.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER [violently] Will you please keep your impertinent remarks\nto yourself?\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER. Did I say that out loud? I didn\u2019t mean to. I beg your\npardon. Your mother\u2019s Epsom, unmistakeably.\n\nTHE MOTHER [advancing between her daughter and the note taker] How very\ncurious! I was brought up in Largelady Park, near Epsom.\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER [uproariously amused] Ha! ha! What a devil of a name!\nExcuse me. [To the daughter] You want a cab, do you?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Don\u2019t dare speak to me.\n\nTHE MOTHER. Oh, please, please Clara. [Her daughter repudiates her with\nan angry shrug and retires haughtily.] We should be so grateful to you,\nsir, if you found us a cab. [The note taker produces a whistle]. Oh,\nthank you. [She joins her daughter]. The note taker blows a piercing\nblast.\n\nTHE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER. There! I knowed he was a plain-clothes copper.\n\nTHE BYSTANDER. That ain\u2019t a police whistle: that\u2019s a sporting whistle.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [still preoccupied with her wounded feelings] He\u2019s no\nright to take away my character. My character is the same to me as any\nlady\u2019s.\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve noticed it; but the rain\nstopped about two minutes ago.\n\nTHE BYSTANDER. So it has. Why didn\u2019t you say so before? and us losing\nour time listening to your silliness. [He walks off towards the Strand].\n\nTHE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER. I can tell where you come from. You come from\nAnwell. Go back there.\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER [helpfully] _H_anwell.\n\nTHE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER [affecting great distinction of speech] Thenk\nyou, teacher. Haw haw! So long [he touches his hat with mock respect\nand strolls off].\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Frightening people like that! How would he like it\nhimself.\n\nTHE MOTHER. It\u2019s quite fine now, Clara. We can walk to a motor bus.\nCome. [She gathers her skirts above her ankles and hurries off towards\nthe Strand].\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. But the cab\u2014[her mother is out of hearing]. Oh, how\ntiresome! [She follows angrily].\n\nAll the rest have gone except the note taker, the gentleman, and the\nflower girl, who sits arranging her basket, and still pitying herself\nin murmurs.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Poor girl! Hard enough for her to live without being\nworrited and chivied.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN [returning to his former place on the note taker\u2019s left]\nHow do you do it, if I may ask?\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER. Simply phonetics. The science of speech. That\u2019s my\nprofession; also my hobby. Happy is the man who can make a living by\nhis hobby! You can spot an Irishman or a Yorkshireman by his brogue. I\ncan place any man within six miles. I can place him within two miles in\nLondon. Sometimes within two streets.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Ought to be ashamed of himself, unmanly coward!\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. But is there a living in that?\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER. Oh yes. Quite a fat one. This is an age of upstarts.\nMen begin in Kentish Town with 80 pounds a year, and end in Park Lane\nwith a hundred thousand. They want to drop Kentish Town; but they give\nthemselves away every time they open their mouths. Now I can teach\nthem\u2014\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Let him mind his own business and leave a poor girl\u2014\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER [explosively] Woman: cease this detestable boohooing\ninstantly; or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [with feeble defiance] I\u2019ve a right to be here if I\nlike, same as you.\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER. A woman who utters such depressing and disgusting\nsounds has no right to be anywhere\u2014no right to live. Remember that you\nare a human being with a soul and the divine gift of articulate speech:\nthat your native language is the language of Shakespear and Milton and\nThe Bible; and don\u2019t sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [quite overwhelmed, and looking up at him in mingled\nwonder and deprecation without daring to raise her head]\nAh\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ow\u2014ow\u2014oo!\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER [whipping out his book] Heavens! what a sound! [He\nwrites; then holds out the book and reads, reproducing her vowels\nexactly] Ah\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ow\u2014ow\u2014ow\u2014oo!\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [tickled by the performance, and laughing in spite of\nherself] Garn!\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER. You see this creature with her kerbstone English: the\nEnglish that will keep her in the gutter to the end of her days. Well,\nsir, in three months I could pass that girl off as a duchess at an\nambassador\u2019s garden party. I could even get her a place as lady\u2019s maid\nor shop assistant, which requires better English. That\u2019s the sort of\nthing I do for commercial millionaires. And on the profits of it I do\ngenuine scientific work in phonetics, and a little as a poet on\nMiltonic lines.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. I am myself a student of Indian dialects; and\u2014\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER [eagerly] Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering, the\nauthor of Spoken Sanscrit?\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. I am Colonel Pickering. Who are you?\n\nTHE NOTE TAKER. Henry Higgins, author of Higgins\u2019s Universal Alphabet.\n\nPICKERING [with enthusiasm] I came from India to meet you.\n\nHIGGINS. I was going to India to meet you.\n\nPICKERING. Where do you live?\n\nHIGGINS. 27A Wimpole Street. Come and see me tomorrow.\n\nPICKERING. I\u2019m at the Carlton. Come with me now and let\u2019s have a jaw\nover some supper.\n\nHIGGINS. Right you are.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [to Pickering, as he passes her] Buy a flower, kind\ngentleman. I\u2019m short for my lodging.\n\nPICKERING. I really haven\u2019t any change. I\u2019m sorry [he goes away].\n\nHIGGINS [shocked at girl\u2019s mendacity] Liar. You said you could change\nhalf-a-crown.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [rising in desperation] You ought to be stuffed with\nnails, you ought. [Flinging the basket at his feet] Take the whole\nblooming basket for sixpence.\n\nThe church clock strikes the second quarter.\n\nHIGGINS [hearing in it the voice of God, rebuking him for his Pharisaic\nwant of charity to the poor girl] A reminder. [He raises his hat\nsolemnly; then throws a handful of money into the basket and follows\nPickering].\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [picking up a half-crown] Ah\u2014ow\u2014ooh! [Picking up a\ncouple of florins] Aaah\u2014ow\u2014ooh! [Picking up several coins]\nAaaaaah\u2014ow\u2014ooh! [Picking up a half-sovereign]\nAasaaaaaaaaah\u2014ow\u2014ooh!!!\n\nFREDDY [springing out of a taxicab] Got one at last. Hallo! [To the\ngirl] Where are the two ladies that were here?\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. They walked to the bus when the rain stopped.\n\nFREDDY. And left me with a cab on my hands. Damnation!\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [with grandeur] Never you mind, young man. I\u2019m going\nhome in a taxi. [She sails off to the cab. The driver puts his hand\nbehind him and holds the door firmly shut against her. Quite\nunderstanding his mistrust, she shows him her handful of money].\nEightpence ain\u2019t no object to me, Charlie. [He grins and opens the\ndoor]. Angel Court, Drury Lane, round the corner of Micklejohn\u2019s oil\nshop. Let\u2019s see how fast you can make her hop it. [She gets in and\npulls the door to with a slam as the taxicab starts].\n\nFREDDY. Well, I\u2019m dashed!\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n\nNext day at 11 a.m. Higgins\u2019s laboratory in Wimpole Street. It is a\nroom on the first floor, looking on the street, and was meant for the\ndrawing-room. The double doors are in the middle of the back hall; and\npersons entering find in the corner to their right two tall file\ncabinets at right angles to one another against the walls. In this\ncorner stands a flat writing-table, on which are a phonograph, a\nlaryngoscope, a row of tiny organ pipes with a bellows, a set of lamp\nchimneys for singing flames with burners attached to a gas plug in the\nwall by an indiarubber tube, several tuning-forks of different sizes, a\nlife-size image of half a human head, showing in section the vocal\norgans, and a box containing a supply of wax cylinders for the\nphonograph.\n\nFurther down the room, on the same side, is a fireplace, with a\ncomfortable leather-covered easy-chair at the side of the hearth\nnearest the door, and a coal-scuttle. There is a clock on the\nmantelpiece. Between the fireplace and the phonograph table is a stand\nfor newspapers.\n\nOn the other side of the central door, to the left of the visitor, is a\ncabinet of shallow drawers. On it is a telephone and the telephone\ndirectory. The corner beyond, and most of the side wall, is occupied by\na grand piano, with the keyboard at the end furthest from the door, and\na bench for the player extending the full length of the keyboard. On\nthe piano is a dessert dish heaped with fruit and sweets, mostly\nchocolates.\n\nThe middle of the room is clear. Besides the easy chair, the piano\nbench, and two chairs at the phonograph table, there is one stray\nchair. It stands near the fireplace. On the walls, engravings; mostly\nPiranesis and mezzotint portraits. No paintings.\n\nPickering is seated at the table, putting down some cards and a\ntuning-fork which he has been using. Higgins is standing up near him,\nclosing two or three file drawers which are hanging out. He appears in\nthe morning light as a robust, vital, appetizing sort of man of forty\nor thereabouts, dressed in a professional-looking black frock-coat with\na white linen collar and black silk tie. He is of the energetic,\nscientific type, heartily, even violently interested in everything that\ncan be studied as a scientific subject, and careless about himself and\nother people, including their feelings. He is, in fact, but for his\nyears and size, rather like a very impetuous baby \u201ctaking notice\u201d\neagerly and loudly, and requiring almost as much watching to keep him\nout of unintended mischief. His manner varies from genial bullying when\nhe is in a good humor to stormy petulance when anything goes wrong; but\nhe is so entirely frank and void of malice that he remains likeable\neven in his least reasonable moments.\n\nHIGGINS [as he shuts the last drawer] Well, I think that\u2019s the whole\nshow.\n\nPICKERING. It\u2019s really amazing. I haven\u2019t taken half of it in, you know.\n\nHIGGINS. Would you like to go over any of it again?\n\nPICKERING [rising and coming to the fireplace, where he plants himself\nwith his back to the fire] No, thank you; not now. I\u2019m quite done up\nfor this morning.\n\nHIGGINS [following him, and standing beside him on his left] Tired of\nlistening to sounds?\n\nPICKERING. Yes. It\u2019s a fearful strain. I rather fancied myself because\nI can pronounce twenty-four distinct vowel sounds; but your hundred and\nthirty beat me. I can\u2019t hear a bit of difference between most of them.\n\nHIGGINS [chuckling, and going over to the piano to eat sweets] Oh, that\ncomes with practice. You hear no difference at first; but you keep on\nlistening, and presently you find they\u2019re all as different as A from B.\n[Mrs. Pearce looks in: she is Higgins\u2019s housekeeper] What\u2019s the matter?\n\nMRS. PEARCE [hesitating, evidently perplexed] A young woman wants to\nsee you, sir.\n\nHIGGINS. A young woman! What does she want?\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Well, sir, she says you\u2019ll be glad to see her when you\nknow what she\u2019s come about. She\u2019s quite a common girl, sir. Very common\nindeed. I should have sent her away, only I thought perhaps you wanted\nher to talk into your machines. I hope I\u2019ve not done wrong; but really\nyou see such queer people sometimes\u2014you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m sure, sir\u2014\n\nHIGGINS. Oh, that\u2019s all right, Mrs. Pearce. Has she an interesting\naccent?\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Oh, something dreadful, sir, really. I don\u2019t know how you\ncan take an interest in it.\n\nHIGGINS [to Pickering] Let\u2019s have her up. Show her up, Mrs. Pearce [he\nrushes across to his working table and picks out a cylinder to use on\nthe phonograph].\n\nMRS. PEARCE [only half resigned to it] Very well, sir. It\u2019s for you to\nsay. [She goes downstairs].\n\nHIGGINS. This is rather a bit of luck. I\u2019ll show you how I make\nrecords. We\u2019ll set her talking; and I\u2019ll take it down first in Bell\u2019s\nvisible Speech; then in broad Romic; and then we\u2019ll get her on the\nphonograph so that you can turn her on as often as you like with the\nwritten transcript before you.\n\nMRS. PEARCE [returning] This is the young woman, sir.\n\nThe flower girl enters in state. She has a hat with three ostrich\nfeathers, orange, sky-blue, and red. She has a nearly clean apron, and\nthe shoddy coat has been tidied a little. The pathos of this deplorable\nfigure, with its innocent vanity and consequential air, touches\nPickering, who has already straightened himself in the presence of Mrs.\nPearce. But as to Higgins, the only distinction he makes between men\nand women is that when he is neither bullying nor exclaiming to the\nheavens against some featherweight cross, he coaxes women as a child\ncoaxes its nurse when it wants to get anything out of her.\n\nHIGGINS [brusquely, recognizing her with unconcealed disappointment,\nand at once, baby-like, making an intolerable grievance of it] Why,\nthis is the girl I jotted down last night. She\u2019s no use: I\u2019ve got all\nthe records I want of the Lisson Grove lingo; and I\u2019m not going to\nwaste another cylinder on it. [To the girl] Be off with you: I don\u2019t\nwant you.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Don\u2019t you be so saucy. You ain\u2019t heard what I come for\nyet. [To Mrs. Pearce, who is waiting at the door for further\ninstruction] Did you tell him I come in a taxi?\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Nonsense, girl! what do you think a gentleman like Mr.\nHiggins cares what you came in?\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Oh, we are proud! He ain\u2019t above giving lessons, not\nhim: I heard him say so. Well, I ain\u2019t come here to ask for any\ncompliment; and if my money\u2019s not good enough I can go elsewhere.\n\nHIGGINS. Good enough for what?\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Good enough for ye\u2014oo. Now you know, don\u2019t you? I\u2019m\ncome to have lessons, I am. And to pay for em too: make no mistake.\n\nHIGGINS [stupent] WELL!!! [Recovering his breath with a gasp] What do\nyou expect me to say to you?\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Well, if you was a gentleman, you might ask me to sit\ndown, I think. Don\u2019t I tell you I\u2019m bringing you business?\n\nHIGGINS. Pickering: shall we ask this baggage to sit down or shall we\nthrow her out of the window?\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [running away in terror to the piano, where she turns\nat bay] Ah\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ow\u2014ow\u2014ow\u2014oo! [Wounded and whimpering] I won\u2019t be\ncalled a baggage when I\u2019ve offered to pay like any lady.\n\nMotionless, the two men stare at her from the other side of the room,\namazed.\n\nPICKERING [gently] What is it you want, my girl?\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. I want to be a lady in a flower shop stead of selling\nat the corner of Tottenham Court Road. But they won\u2019t take me unless I\ncan talk more genteel. He said he could teach me. Well, here I am ready\nto pay him\u2014not asking any favor\u2014and he treats me as if I was dirt.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. How can you be such a foolish ignorant girl as to think\nyou could afford to pay Mr. Higgins?\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Why shouldn\u2019t I? I know what lessons cost as well as\nyou do; and I\u2019m ready to pay.\n\nHIGGINS. How much?\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL [coming back to him, triumphant] Now you\u2019re talking! I\nthought you\u2019d come off it when you saw a chance of getting back a bit\nof what you chucked at me last night. [Confidentially] You\u2019d had a drop\nin, hadn\u2019t you?\n\nHIGGINS [peremptorily] Sit down.\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Oh, if you\u2019re going to make a compliment of it\u2014\n\nHIGGINS [thundering at her] Sit down.\n\nMRS. PEARCE [severely] Sit down, girl. Do as you\u2019re told. [She places\nthe stray chair near the hearthrug between Higgins and Pickering, and\nstands behind it waiting for the girl to sit down].\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Ah\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ow\u2014ow\u2014oo! [She stands, half rebellious,\nhalf bewildered].\n\nPICKERING [very courteous] Won\u2019t you sit down?\n\nLIZA [coyly] Don\u2019t mind if I do. [She sits down. Pickering returns to\nthe hearthrug].\n\nHIGGINS. What\u2019s your name?\n\nTHE FLOWER GIRL. Liza Doolittle.\n\nHIGGINS [declaiming gravely]\n       Eliza, Elizabeth, Betsy and Bess,\n       They went to the woods to get a bird\u2019s nes\u2019:\n\nPICKERING. They found a nest with four eggs in it:\n\nHIGGINS. They took one apiece, and left three in it.\n\nThey laugh heartily at their own wit.\n\nLIZA. Oh, don\u2019t be silly.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. You mustn\u2019t speak to the gentleman like that.\n\nLIZA. Well, why won\u2019t he speak sensible to me?\n\nHIGGINS. Come back to business. How much do you propose to pay me for\nthe lessons?\n\nLIZA. Oh, I know what\u2019s right. A lady friend of mine gets French\nlessons for eighteenpence an hour from a real French gentleman. Well,\nyou wouldn\u2019t have the face to ask me the same for teaching me my own\nlanguage as you would for French; so I won\u2019t give more than a shilling.\nTake it or leave it.\n\nHIGGINS [walking up and down the room, rattling his keys and his cash\nin his pockets] You know, Pickering, if you consider a shilling, not as\na simple shilling, but as a percentage of this girl\u2019s income, it works\nout as fully equivalent to sixty or seventy guineas from a millionaire.\n\nPICKERING. How so?\n\nHIGGINS. Figure it out. A millionaire has about 150 pounds a day. She\nearns about half-a-crown.\n\nLIZA [haughtily] Who told you I only\u2014\n\nHIGGINS [continuing] She offers me two-fifths of her day\u2019s income for a\nlesson. Two-fifths of a millionaire\u2019s income for a day would be\nsomewhere about 60 pounds. It\u2019s handsome. By George, it\u2019s enormous!\nit\u2019s the biggest offer I ever had.\n\nLIZA [rising, terrified] Sixty pounds! What are you talking about? I\nnever offered you sixty pounds. Where would I get\u2014\n\nHIGGINS. Hold your tongue.\n\nLIZA [weeping] But I ain\u2019t got sixty pounds. Oh\u2014\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Don\u2019t cry, you silly girl. Sit down. Nobody is going to\ntouch your money.\n\nHIGGINS. Somebody is going to touch you, with a broomstick, if you\ndon\u2019t stop snivelling. Sit down.\n\nLIZA [obeying slowly] Ah\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ow\u2014oo\u2014o! One would think you was my\nfather.\n\nHIGGINS. If I decide to teach you, I\u2019ll be worse than two fathers to\nyou. Here [he offers her his silk handkerchief]!\n\nLIZA. What\u2019s this for?\n\nHIGGINS. To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part of your face that feels\nmoist. Remember: that\u2019s your handkerchief; and that\u2019s your sleeve.\nDon\u2019t mistake the one for the other if you wish to become a lady in a\nshop.\n\nLiza, utterly bewildered, stares helplessly at him.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. It\u2019s no use talking to her like that, Mr. Higgins: she\ndoesn\u2019t understand you. Besides, you\u2019re quite wrong: she doesn\u2019t do it\nthat way at all [she takes the handkerchief].\n\nLIZA [snatching it] Here! You give me that handkerchief. He give it to\nme, not to you.\n\nPICKERING [laughing] He did. I think it must be regarded as her\nproperty, Mrs. Pearce.\n\nMRS. PEARCE [resigning herself] Serve you right, Mr. Higgins.\n\nPICKERING. Higgins: I\u2019m interested. What about the ambassador\u2019s garden\nparty? I\u2019ll say you\u2019re the greatest teacher alive if you make that\ngood. I\u2019ll bet you all the expenses of the experiment you can\u2019t do it.\nAnd I\u2019ll pay for the lessons.\n\nLIZA. Oh, you are real good. Thank you, Captain.\n\nHIGGINS [tempted, looking at her] It\u2019s almost irresistible. She\u2019s so\ndeliciously low\u2014so horribly dirty\u2014\n\nLIZA [protesting extremely] Ah\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ow\u2014ow\u2014oooo!!! I ain\u2019t\ndirty: I washed my face and hands afore I come, I did.\n\nPICKERING. You\u2019re certainly not going to turn her head with flattery,\nHiggins.\n\nMRS. PEARCE [uneasy] Oh, don\u2019t say that, sir: there\u2019s more ways than\none of turning a girl\u2019s head; and nobody can do it better than Mr.\nHiggins, though he may not always mean it. I do hope, sir, you won\u2019t\nencourage him to do anything foolish.\n\nHIGGINS [becoming excited as the idea grows on him] What is life but a\nseries of inspired follies? The difficulty is to find them to do. Never\nlose a chance: it doesn\u2019t come every day. I shall make a duchess of\nthis draggletailed guttersnipe.\n\nLIZA [strongly deprecating this view of her] Ah\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ow\u2014ow\u2014oo!\n\nHIGGINS [carried away] Yes: in six months\u2014in three if she has a good\near and a quick tongue\u2014I\u2019ll take her anywhere and pass her off as\nanything. We\u2019ll start today: now! this moment! Take her away and clean\nher, Mrs. Pearce. Monkey Brand, if it won\u2019t come off any other way. Is\nthere a good fire in the kitchen?\n\nMRS. PEARCE [protesting]. Yes; but\u2014\n\nHIGGINS [storming on] Take all her clothes off and burn them. Ring up\nWhiteley or somebody for new ones. Wrap her up in brown paper till they\ncome.\n\nLIZA. You\u2019re no gentleman, you\u2019re not, to talk of such things. I\u2019m a\ngood girl, I am; and I know what the like of you are, I do.\n\nHIGGINS. We want none of your Lisson Grove prudery here, young woman.\nYou\u2019ve got to learn to behave like a duchess. Take her away, Mrs.\nPearce. If she gives you any trouble wallop her.\n\nLIZA [springing up and running between Pickering and Mrs. Pearce for\nprotection] No! I\u2019ll call the police, I will.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. But I\u2019ve no place to put her.\n\nHIGGINS. Put her in the dustbin.\n\nLIZA. Ah\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ow\u2014ow\u2014oo!\n\nPICKERING. Oh come, Higgins! be reasonable.\n\nMRS. PEARCE [resolutely] You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins: really\nyou must. You can\u2019t walk over everybody like this.\n\nHiggins, thus scolded, subsides. The hurricane is succeeded by a zephyr\nof amiable surprise.\n\nHIGGINS [with professional exquisiteness of modulation] I walk over\neverybody! My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering, I never had the\nslightest intention of walking over anyone. All I propose is that we\nshould be kind to this poor girl. We must help her to prepare and fit\nherself for her new station in life. If I did not express myself\nclearly it was because I did not wish to hurt her delicacy, or yours.\n\nLiza, reassured, steals back to her chair.\n\nMRS. PEARCE [to Pickering] Well, did you ever hear anything like that,\nsir?\n\nPICKERING [laughing heartily] Never, Mrs. Pearce: never.\n\nHIGGINS [patiently] What\u2019s the matter?\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Well, the matter is, sir, that you can\u2019t take a girl up\nlike that as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach.\n\nHIGGINS. Why not?\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Why not! But you don\u2019t know anything about her. What about\nher parents? She may be married.\n\nLIZA. Garn!\n\nHIGGINS. There! As the girl very properly says, Garn! Married indeed!\nDon\u2019t you know that a woman of that class looks a worn out drudge of\nfifty a year after she\u2019s married.\n\nLIZA. Who\u2019d marry me?\n\nHIGGINS [suddenly resorting to the most thrillingly beautiful low tones\nin his best elocutionary style] By George, Eliza, the streets will be\nstrewn with the bodies of men shooting themselves for your sake before\nI\u2019ve done with you.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Nonsense, sir. You mustn\u2019t talk like that to her.\n\nLIZA [rising and squaring herself determinedly] I\u2019m going away. He\u2019s\noff his chump, he is. I don\u2019t want no balmies teaching me.\n\nHIGGINS [wounded in his tenderest point by her insensibility to his\nelocution] Oh, indeed! I\u2019m mad, am I? Very well, Mrs. Pearce: you\nneedn\u2019t order the new clothes for her. Throw her out.\n\nLIZA [whimpering] Nah\u2014ow. You got no right to touch me.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. You see now what comes of being saucy. [Indicating the\ndoor] This way, please.\n\nLIZA [almost in tears] I didn\u2019t want no clothes. I wouldn\u2019t have taken\nthem [she throws away the handkerchief]. I can buy my own clothes.\n\nHIGGINS [deftly retrieving the handkerchief and intercepting her on her\nreluctant way to the door] You\u2019re an ungrateful wicked girl. This is my\nreturn for offering to take you out of the gutter and dress you\nbeautifully and make a lady of you.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Stop, Mr. Higgins. I won\u2019t allow it. It\u2019s you that are\nwicked. Go home to your parents, girl; and tell them to take better\ncare of you.\n\nLIZA. I ain\u2019t got no parents. They told me I was big enough to earn my\nown living and turned me out.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Where\u2019s your mother?\n\nLIZA. I ain\u2019t got no mother. Her that turned me out was my sixth\nstepmother. But I done without them. And I\u2019m a good girl, I am.\n\nHIGGINS. Very well, then, what on earth is all this fuss about? The\ngirl doesn\u2019t belong to anybody\u2014is no use to anybody but me. [He goes\nto Mrs. Pearce and begins coaxing]. You can adopt her, Mrs. Pearce: I\u2019m\nsure a daughter would be a great amusement to you. Now don\u2019t make any\nmore fuss. Take her downstairs; and\u2014\n\nMRS. PEARCE. But what\u2019s to become of her? Is she to be paid anything?\nDo be sensible, sir.\n\nHIGGINS. Oh, pay her whatever is necessary: put it down in the\nhousekeeping book. [Impatiently] What on earth will she want with\nmoney? She\u2019ll have her food and her clothes. She\u2019ll only drink if you\ngive her money.\n\nLIZA [turning on him] Oh you are a brute. It\u2019s a lie: nobody ever saw\nthe sign of liquor on me. [She goes back to her chair and plants\nherself there defiantly].\n\nPICKERING [in good-humored remonstrance] Does it occur to you, Higgins,\nthat the girl has some feelings?\n\nHIGGINS [looking critically at her] Oh no, I don\u2019t think so. Not any\nfeelings that we need bother about. [Cheerily] Have you, Eliza?\n\nLIZA. I got my feelings same as anyone else.\n\nHIGGINS [to Pickering, reflectively] You see the difficulty?\n\nPICKERING. Eh? What difficulty?\n\nHIGGINS. To get her to talk grammar. The mere pronunciation is easy\nenough.\n\nLIZA. I don\u2019t want to talk grammar. I want to talk like a lady.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Will you please keep to the point, Mr. Higgins. I want to\nknow on what terms the girl is to be here. Is she to have any wages?\nAnd what is to become of her when you\u2019ve finished your teaching? You\nmust look ahead a little.\n\nHIGGINS [impatiently] What\u2019s to become of her if I leave her in the\ngutter? Tell me that, Mrs. Pearce.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. That\u2019s her own business, not yours, Mr. Higgins.\n\nHIGGINS. Well, when I\u2019ve done with her, we can throw her back into the\ngutter; and then it will be her own business again; so that\u2019s all right.\n\nLIZA. Oh, you\u2019ve no feeling heart in you: you don\u2019t care for nothing\nbut yourself [she rises and takes the floor resolutely]. Here! I\u2019ve had\nenough of this. I\u2019m going [making for the door]. You ought to be\nashamed of yourself, you ought.\n\nHIGGINS [snatching a chocolate cream from the piano, his eyes suddenly\nbeginning to twinkle with mischief] Have some chocolates, Eliza.\n\nLIZA [halting, tempted] How do I know what might be in them? I\u2019ve heard\nof girls being drugged by the like of you.\n\nHiggins whips out his penknife; cuts a chocolate in two; puts one half\ninto his mouth and bolts it; and offers her the other half.\n\nHIGGINS. Pledge of good faith, Eliza. I eat one half you eat the other.\n\n[Liza opens her mouth to retort: he pops the half chocolate into it].\nYou shall have boxes of them, barrels of them, every day. You shall\nlive on them. Eh?\n\nLIZA [who has disposed of the chocolate after being nearly choked by\nit] I wouldn\u2019t have ate it, only I\u2019m too ladylike to take it out of my\nmouth.\n\nHIGGINS. Listen, Eliza. I think you said you came in a taxi.\n\nLIZA. Well, what if I did? I\u2019ve as good a right to take a taxi as\nanyone else.\n\nHIGGINS. You have, Eliza; and in future you shall have as many taxis as\nyou want. You shall go up and down and round the town in a taxi every\nday. Think of that, Eliza.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Mr. Higgins: you\u2019re tempting the girl. It\u2019s not right. She\nshould think of the future.\n\nHIGGINS. At her age! Nonsense! Time enough to think of the future when\nyou haven\u2019t any future to think of. No, Eliza: do as this lady does:\nthink of other people\u2019s futures; but never think of your own. Think of\nchocolates, and taxis, and gold, and diamonds.\n\nLIZA. No: I don\u2019t want no gold and no diamonds. I\u2019m a good girl, I am.\n[She sits down again, with an attempt at dignity].\n\nHIGGINS. You shall remain so, Eliza, under the care of Mrs. Pearce. And\nyou shall marry an officer in the Guards, with a beautiful moustache:\nthe son of a marquis, who will disinherit him for marrying you, but\nwill relent when he sees your beauty and goodness\u2014\n\nPICKERING. Excuse me, Higgins; but I really must interfere. Mrs. Pearce\nis quite right. If this girl is to put herself in your hands for six\nmonths for an experiment in teaching, she must understand thoroughly\nwhat she\u2019s doing.\n\nHIGGINS. How can she? She\u2019s incapable of understanding anything.\nBesides, do any of us understand what we are doing? If we did, would we\never do it?\n\nPICKERING. Very clever, Higgins; but not sound sense. [To Eliza] Miss\nDoolittle\u2014\n\nLIZA [overwhelmed] Ah\u2014ah\u2014ow\u2014oo!\n\nHIGGINS. There! That\u2019s all you get out of Eliza. Ah\u2014ah\u2014ow\u2014oo! No use\nexplaining. As a military man you ought to know that. Give her her\norders: that\u2019s what she wants. Eliza: you are to live here for the next\nsix months, learning how to speak beautifully, like a lady in a\nflorist\u2019s shop. If you\u2019re good and do whatever you\u2019re told, you shall\nsleep in a proper bedroom, and have lots to eat, and money to buy\nchocolates and take rides in taxis. If you\u2019re naughty and idle you will\nsleep in the back kitchen among the black beetles, and be walloped by\nMrs. Pearce with a broomstick. At the end of six months you shall go to\nBuckingham Palace in a carriage, beautifully dressed. If the King finds\nout you\u2019re not a lady, you will be taken by the police to the Tower of\nLondon, where your head will be cut off as a warning to other\npresumptuous flower girls. If you are not found out, you shall have a\npresent of seven-and-sixpence to start life with as a lady in a shop.\nIf you refuse this offer you will be a most ungrateful and wicked girl;\nand the angels will weep for you. [To Pickering] Now are you satisfied,\nPickering? [To Mrs. Pearce] Can I put it more plainly and fairly, Mrs.\nPearce?\n\nMRS. PEARCE [patiently] I think you\u2019d better let me speak to the girl\nproperly in private. I don\u2019t know that I can take charge of her or\nconsent to the arrangement at all. Of course I know you don\u2019t mean her\nany harm; but when you get what you call interested in people\u2019s\naccents, you never think or care what may happen to them or you. Come\nwith me, Eliza.\n\nHIGGINS. That\u2019s all right. Thank you, Mrs. Pearce. Bundle her off to\nthe bath-room.\n\nLIZA [rising reluctantly and suspiciously] You\u2019re a great bully, you\nare. I won\u2019t stay here if I don\u2019t like. I won\u2019t let nobody wallop me. I\nnever asked to go to Bucknam Palace, I didn\u2019t. I was never in trouble\nwith the police, not me. I\u2019m a good girl\u2014\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Don\u2019t answer back, girl. You don\u2019t understand the\ngentleman. Come with me. [She leads the way to the door, and holds it\nopen for Eliza].\n\nLIZA [as she goes out] Well, what I say is right. I won\u2019t go near the\nking, not if I\u2019m going to have my head cut off. If I\u2019d known what I was\nletting myself in for, I wouldn\u2019t have come here. I always been a good\ngirl; and I never offered to say a word to him; and I don\u2019t owe him\nnothing; and I don\u2019t care; and I won\u2019t be put upon; and I have my\nfeelings the same as anyone else\u2014\n\nMrs. Pearce shuts the door; and Eliza\u2019s plaints are no longer audible.\nPickering comes from the hearth to the chair and sits astride it with\nhis arms on the back.\n\nPICKERING. Excuse the straight question, Higgins. Are you a man of good\ncharacter where women are concerned?\n\nHIGGINS [moodily] Have you ever met a man of good character where women\nare concerned?\n\nPICKERING. Yes: very frequently.\n\nHIGGINS [dogmatically, lifting himself on his hands to the level of the\npiano, and sitting on it with a bounce] Well, I haven\u2019t. I find that\nthe moment I let a woman make friends with me, she becomes jealous,\nexacting, suspicious, and a damned nuisance. I find that the moment I\nlet myself make friends with a woman, I become selfish and tyrannical.\nWomen upset everything. When you let them into your life, you find that\nthe woman is driving at one thing and you\u2019re driving at another.\n\nPICKERING. At what, for example?\n\nHIGGINS [coming off the piano restlessly] Oh, Lord knows! I suppose the\nwoman wants to live her own life; and the man wants to live his; and\neach tries to drag the other on to the wrong track. One wants to go\nnorth and the other south; and the result is that both have to go east,\nthough they both hate the east wind. [He sits down on the bench at the\nkeyboard]. So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor, and likely to remain\nso.\n\nPICKERING [rising and standing over him gravely] Come, Higgins! You\nknow what I mean. If I\u2019m to be in this business I shall feel\nresponsible for that girl. I hope it\u2019s understood that no advantage is\nto be taken of her position.\n\nHIGGINS. What! That thing! Sacred, I assure you. [Rising to explain]\nYou see, she\u2019ll be a pupil; and teaching would be impossible unless\npupils were sacred. I\u2019ve taught scores of American millionairesses how\nto speak English: the best looking women in the world. I\u2019m seasoned.\nThey might as well be blocks of wood. I might as well be a block of\nwood. It\u2019s\u2014\n\nMrs. Pearce opens the door. She has Eliza\u2019s hat in her hand. Pickering\nretires to the easy-chair at the hearth and sits down.\n\nHIGGINS [eagerly] Well, Mrs. Pearce: is it all right?\n\nMRS. PEARCE [at the door] I just wish to trouble you with a word, if I\nmay, Mr. Higgins.\n\nHIGGINS. Yes, certainly. Come in. [She comes forward]. Don\u2019t burn that,\nMrs. Pearce. I\u2019ll keep it as a curiosity. [He takes the hat].\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Handle it carefully, sir, please. I had to promise her not\nto burn it; but I had better put it in the oven for a while.\n\nHIGGINS [putting it down hastily on the piano] Oh! thank you. Well,\nwhat have you to say to me?\n\nPICKERING. Am I in the way?\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Not at all, sir. Mr. Higgins: will you please be very\nparticular what you say before the girl?\n\nHIGGINS [sternly] Of course. I\u2019m always particular about what I say.\nWhy do you say this to me?\n\nMRS. PEARCE [unmoved] No, sir: you\u2019re not at all particular when you\u2019ve\nmislaid anything or when you get a little impatient. Now it doesn\u2019t\nmatter before me: I\u2019m used to it. But you really must not swear before\nthe girl.\n\nHIGGINS [indignantly] I swear! [Most emphatically] I never swear. I\ndetest the habit. What the devil do you mean?\n\nMRS. PEARCE [stolidly] That\u2019s what I mean, sir. You swear a great deal\ntoo much. I don\u2019t mind your damning and blasting, and what the devil\nand where the devil and who the devil\u2014\n\nHIGGINS. Really! Mrs. Pearce: this language from your lips!\n\nMRS. PEARCE [not to be put off]\u2014but there is a certain word I must ask\nyou not to use. The girl has just used it herself because the bath was\ntoo hot. It begins with the same letter as bath. She knows no better:\nshe learnt it at her mother\u2019s knee. But she must not hear it from your\nlips.\n\nHIGGINS [loftily] I cannot charge myself with having ever uttered it,\nMrs. Pearce. [She looks at him steadfastly. He adds, hiding an uneasy\nconscience with a judicial air] Except perhaps in a moment of extreme\nand justifiable excitement.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Only this morning, sir, you applied it to your boots, to\nthe butter, and to the brown bread.\n\nHIGGINS. Oh, that! Mere alliteration, Mrs. Pearce, natural to a poet.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Well, sir, whatever you choose to call it, I beg you not\nto let the girl hear you repeat it.\n\nHIGGINS. Oh, very well, very well. Is that all?\n\nMRS. PEARCE. No, sir. We shall have to be very particular with this\ngirl as to personal cleanliness.\n\nHIGGINS. Certainly. Quite right. Most important.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. I mean not to be slovenly about her dress or untidy in\nleaving things about.\n\nHIGGINS [going to her solemnly] Just so. I intended to call your\nattention to that [He passes on to Pickering, who is enjoying the\nconversation immensely]. It is these little things that matter,\nPickering. Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of\nthemselves is as true of personal habits as of money. [He comes to\nanchor on the hearthrug, with the air of a man in an unassailable\nposition].\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Yes, sir. Then might I ask you not to come down to\nbreakfast in your dressing-gown, or at any rate not to use it as a\nnapkin to the extent you do, sir. And if you would be so good as not to\neat everything off the same plate, and to remember not to put the\nporridge saucepan out of your hand on the clean tablecloth, it would be\na better example to the girl. You know you nearly choked yourself with\na fishbone in the jam only last week.\n\nHIGGINS [routed from the hearthrug and drifting back to the piano] I\nmay do these things sometimes in absence of mind; but surely I don\u2019t do\nthem habitually. [Angrily] By the way: my dressing-gown smells most\ndamnably of benzine.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. No doubt it does, Mr. Higgins. But if you will wipe your\nfingers\u2014\n\nHIGGINS [yelling] Oh very well, very well: I\u2019ll wipe them in my hair in\nfuture.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. I hope you\u2019re not offended, Mr. Higgins.\n\nHIGGINS [shocked at finding himself thought capable of an unamiable\nsentiment] Not at all, not at all. You\u2019re quite right, Mrs. Pearce: I\nshall be particularly careful before the girl. Is that all?\n\nMRS. PEARCE. No, sir. Might she use some of those Japanese dresses you\nbrought from abroad? I really can\u2019t put her back into her old things.\n\nHIGGINS. Certainly. Anything you like. Is that all?\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Thank you, sir. That\u2019s all. [She goes out].\n\nHIGGINS. You know, Pickering, that woman has the most extraordinary\nideas about me. Here I am, a shy, diffident sort of man. I\u2019ve never\nbeen able to feel really grown-up and tremendous, like other chaps. And\nyet she\u2019s firmly persuaded that I\u2019m an arbitrary overbearing bossing\nkind of person. I can\u2019t account for it.\n\nMrs. Pearce returns.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. If you please, sir, the trouble\u2019s beginning already.\nThere\u2019s a dustman downstairs, Alfred Doolittle, wants to see you. He\nsays you have his daughter here.\n\nPICKERING [rising] Phew! I say! [He retreats to the hearthrug].\n\nHIGGINS [promptly] Send the blackguard up.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Oh, very well, sir. [She goes out].\n\nPICKERING. He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.\n\nHIGGINS. Nonsense. Of course he\u2019s a blackguard.\n\nPICKERING. Whether he is or not, I\u2019m afraid we shall have some trouble\nwith him.\n\nHIGGINS [confidently] Oh no: I think not. If there\u2019s any trouble he\nshall have it with me, not I with him. And we are sure to get something\ninteresting out of him.\n\nPICKERING. About the girl?\n\nHIGGINS. No. I mean his dialect.\n\nPICKERING. Oh!\n\nMRS. PEARCE [at the door] Doolittle, sir. [She admits Doolittle and\nretires].\n\nAlfred Doolittle is an elderly but vigorous dustman, clad in the\ncostume of his profession, including a hat with a back brim covering\nhis neck and shoulders. He has well marked and rather interesting\nfeatures, and seems equally free from fear and conscience. He has a\nremarkably expressive voice, the result of a habit of giving vent to\nhis feelings without reserve. His present pose is that of wounded honor\nand stern resolution.\n\nDOOLITTLE [at the door, uncertain which of the two gentlemen is his\nman] Professor Higgins?\n\nHIGGINS. Here. Good morning. Sit down.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Morning, Governor. [He sits down magisterially] I come about\na very serious matter, Governor.\n\nHIGGINS [to Pickering] Brought up in Hounslow. Mother Welsh, I should\nthink. [Doolittle opens his mouth, amazed. Higgins continues] What do\nyou want, Doolittle?\n\nDOOLITTLE [menacingly] I want my daughter: that\u2019s what I want. See?\n\nHIGGINS. Of course you do. You\u2019re her father, aren\u2019t you? You don\u2019t\nsuppose anyone else wants her, do you? I\u2019m glad to see you have some\nspark of family feeling left. She\u2019s upstairs. Take her away at once.\n\nDOOLITTLE [rising, fearfully taken aback] What!\n\nHIGGINS. Take her away. Do you suppose I\u2019m going to keep your daughter\nfor you?\n\nDOOLITTLE [remonstrating] Now, now, look here, Governor. Is this\nreasonable? Is it fair to take advantage of a man like this? The girl\nbelongs to me. You got her. Where do I come in? [He sits down again].\n\nHIGGINS. Your daughter had the audacity to come to my house and ask me\nto teach her how to speak properly so that she could get a place in a\nflower-shop. This gentleman and my housekeeper have been here all the\ntime. [Bullying him] How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail\nme? You sent her here on purpose.\n\nDOOLITTLE [protesting] No, Governor.\n\nHIGGINS. You must have. How else could you possibly know that she is\nhere?\n\nDOOLITTLE. Don\u2019t take a man up like that, Governor.\n\nHIGGINS. The police shall take you up. This is a plant\u2014a plot to\nextort money by threats. I shall telephone for the police [he goes\nresolutely to the telephone and opens the directory].\n\nDOOLITTLE. Have I asked you for a brass farthing? I leave it to the\ngentleman here: have I said a word about money?\n\nHIGGINS [throwing the book aside and marching down on Doolittle with a\nposer] What else did you come for?\n\nDOOLITTLE [sweetly] Well, what would a man come for? Be human, governor.\n\nHIGGINS [disarmed] Alfred: did you put her up to it?\n\nDOOLITTLE. So help me, Governor, I never did. I take my Bible oath I\nain\u2019t seen the girl these two months past.\n\nHIGGINS. Then how did you know she was here?\n\nDOOLITTLE [\u201cmost musical, most melancholy\u201d] I\u2019ll tell you, Governor, if\nyou\u2019ll only let me get a word in. I\u2019m willing to tell you. I\u2019m wanting\nto tell you. I\u2019m waiting to tell you.\n\nHIGGINS. Pickering: this chap has a certain natural gift of rhetoric.\nObserve the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild. \u201cI\u2019m willing to tell\nyou: I\u2019m wanting to tell you: I\u2019m waiting to tell you.\u201d Sentimental\nrhetoric! That\u2019s the Welsh strain in him. It also accounts for his\nmendacity and dishonesty.\n\nPICKERING. Oh, PLEASE, Higgins: I\u2019m west country myself. [To Doolittle]\nHow did you know the girl was here if you didn\u2019t send her?\n\nDOOLITTLE. It was like this, Governor. The girl took a boy in the taxi\nto give him a jaunt. Son of her landlady, he is. He hung about on the\nchance of her giving him another ride home. Well, she sent him back for\nher luggage when she heard you was willing for her to stop here. I met\nthe boy at the corner of Long Acre and Endell Street.\n\nHIGGINS. Public house. Yes?\n\nDOOLITTLE. The poor man\u2019s club, Governor: why shouldn\u2019t I?\n\nPICKERING. Do let him tell his story, Higgins.\n\nDOOLITTLE. He told me what was up. And I ask you, what was my feelings\nand my duty as a father? I says to the boy, \u201cYou bring me the luggage,\u201d\nI says\u2014\n\nPICKERING. Why didn\u2019t you go for it yourself?\n\nDOOLITTLE. Landlady wouldn\u2019t have trusted me with it, Governor. She\u2019s\nthat kind of woman: you know. I had to give the boy a penny afore he\ntrusted me with it, the little swine. I brought it to her just to\noblige you like, and make myself agreeable. That\u2019s all.\n\nHIGGINS. How much luggage?\n\nDOOLITTLE. Musical instrument, Governor. A few pictures, a trifle of\njewelry, and a bird-cage. She said she didn\u2019t want no clothes. What was\nI to think from that, Governor? I ask you as a parent what was I to\nthink?\n\nHIGGINS. So you came to rescue her from worse than death, eh?\n\nDOOLITTLE [appreciatively: relieved at being understood] Just so,\nGovernor. That\u2019s right.\n\nPICKERING. But why did you bring her luggage if you intended to take\nher away?\n\nDOOLITTLE. Have I said a word about taking her away? Have I now?\n\nHIGGINS [determinedly] You\u2019re going to take her away, double quick. [He\ncrosses to the hearth and rings the bell].\n\nDOOLITTLE [rising] No, Governor. Don\u2019t say that. I\u2019m not the man to\nstand in my girl\u2019s light. Here\u2019s a career opening for her, as you might\nsay; and\u2014\n\nMrs. Pearce opens the door and awaits orders.\n\nHIGGINS. Mrs. Pearce: this is Eliza\u2019s father. He has come to take her\naway. Give her to him. [He goes back to the piano, with an air of\nwashing his hands of the whole affair].\n\nDOOLITTLE. No. This is a misunderstanding. Listen here\u2014\n\nMRS. PEARCE. He can\u2019t take her away, Mr. Higgins: how can he? You told\nme to burn her clothes.\n\nDOOLITTLE. That\u2019s right. I can\u2019t carry the girl through the streets\nlike a blooming monkey, can I? I put it to you.\n\nHIGGINS. You have put it to me that you want your daughter. Take your\ndaughter. If she has no clothes go out and buy her some.\n\nDOOLITTLE [desperate] Where\u2019s the clothes she come in? Did I burn them\nor did your missus here?\n\nMRS. PEARCE. I am the housekeeper, if you please. I have sent for some\nclothes for your girl. When they come you can take her away. You can\nwait in the kitchen. This way, please.\n\nDoolittle, much troubled, accompanies her to the door; then hesitates;\nfinally turns confidentially to Higgins.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Listen here, Governor. You and me is men of the world, ain\u2019t\nwe?\n\nHIGGINS. Oh! Men of the world, are we? You\u2019d better go, Mrs. Pearce.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. I think so, indeed, sir. [She goes, with dignity].\n\nPICKERING. The floor is yours, Mr. Doolittle.\n\nDOOLITTLE [to Pickering] I thank you, Governor. [To Higgins, who takes\nrefuge on the piano bench, a little overwhelmed by the proximity of his\nvisitor; for Doolittle has a professional flavor of dust about him].\nWell, the truth is, I\u2019ve taken a sort of fancy to you, Governor; and if\nyou want the girl, I\u2019m not so set on having her back home again but\nwhat I might be open to an arrangement. Regarded in the light of a\nyoung woman, she\u2019s a fine handsome girl. As a daughter she\u2019s not worth\nher keep; and so I tell you straight. All I ask is my rights as a\nfather; and you\u2019re the last man alive to expect me to let her go for\nnothing; for I can see you\u2019re one of the straight sort, Governor. Well,\nwhat\u2019s a five pound note to you? And what\u2019s Eliza to me? [He returns to\nhis chair and sits down judicially].\n\nPICKERING. I think you ought to know, Doolittle, that Mr. Higgins\u2019s\nintentions are entirely honorable.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Course they are, Governor. If I thought they wasn\u2019t, I\u2019d ask\nfifty.\n\nHIGGINS [revolted] Do you mean to say, you callous rascal, that you\nwould sell your daughter for 50 pounds?\n\nDOOLITTLE. Not in a general way I wouldn\u2019t; but to oblige a gentleman\nlike you I\u2019d do a good deal, I do assure you.\n\nPICKERING. Have you no morals, man?\n\nDOOLITTLE [unabashed] Can\u2019t afford them, Governor. Neither could you if\nyou was as poor as me. Not that I mean any harm, you know. But if Liza\nis going to have a bit out of this, why not me too?\n\nHIGGINS [troubled] I don\u2019t know what to do, Pickering. There can be no\nquestion that as a matter of morals it\u2019s a positive crime to give this\nchap a farthing. And yet I feel a sort of rough justice in his claim.\n\nDOOLITTLE. That\u2019s it, Governor. That\u2019s all I say. A father\u2019s heart, as\nit were.\n\nPICKERING. Well, I know the feeling; but really it seems hardly right\u2014\n\nDOOLITTLE. Don\u2019t say that, Governor. Don\u2019t look at it that way. What am\nI, Governors both? I ask you, what am I? I\u2019m one of the undeserving\npoor: that\u2019s what I am. Think of what that means to a man. It means\nthat he\u2019s up agen middle class morality all the time. If there\u2019s\nanything going, and I put in for a bit of it, it\u2019s always the same\nstory: \u201cYou\u2019re undeserving; so you can\u2019t have it.\u201d But my needs is as\ngreat as the most deserving widow\u2019s that ever got money out of six\ndifferent charities in one week for the death of the same husband. I\ndon\u2019t need less than a deserving man: I need more. I don\u2019t eat less\nhearty than him; and I drink a lot more. I want a bit of amusement,\ncause I\u2019m a thinking man. I want cheerfulness and a song and a band\nwhen I feel low. Well, they charge me just the same for everything as\nthey charge the deserving. What is middle class morality? Just an\nexcuse for never giving me anything. Therefore, I ask you, as two\ngentlemen, not to play that game on me. I\u2019m playing straight with you.\nI ain\u2019t pretending to be deserving. I\u2019m undeserving; and I mean to go\non being undeserving. I like it; and that\u2019s the truth. Will you take\nadvantage of a man\u2019s nature to do him out of the price of his own\ndaughter what he\u2019s brought up and fed and clothed by the sweat of his\nbrow until she\u2019s growed big enough to be interesting to you two\ngentlemen? Is five pounds unreasonable? I put it to you; and I leave it\nto you.\n\nHIGGINS [rising, and going over to Pickering] Pickering: if we were to\ntake this man in hand for three months, he could choose between a seat\nin the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.\n\nPICKERING. What do you say to that, Doolittle?\n\nDOOLITTLE. Not me, Governor, thank you kindly. I\u2019ve heard all the\npreachers and all the prime ministers\u2014for I\u2019m a thinking man and game\nfor politics or religion or social reform same as all the other\namusements\u2014and I tell you it\u2019s a dog\u2019s life anyway you look at it.\nUndeserving poverty is my line. Taking one station in society with\nanother, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s\u2014well, it\u2019s the only one that has any ginger in it,\nto my taste.\n\nHIGGINS. I suppose we must give him a fiver.\n\nPICKERING. He\u2019ll make a bad use of it, I\u2019m afraid.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Not me, Governor, so help me I won\u2019t. Don\u2019t you be afraid\nthat I\u2019ll save it and spare it and live idle on it. There won\u2019t be a\npenny of it left by Monday: I\u2019ll have to go to work same as if I\u2019d\nnever had it. It won\u2019t pauperize me, you bet. Just one good spree for\nmyself and the missus, giving pleasure to ourselves and employment to\nothers, and satisfaction to you to think it\u2019s not been throwed away.\nYou couldn\u2019t spend it better.\n\nHIGGINS [taking out his pocket book and coming between Doolittle and\nthe piano] This is irresistible. Let\u2019s give him ten. [He offers two\nnotes to the dustman].\n\nDOOLITTLE. No, Governor. She wouldn\u2019t have the heart to spend ten; and\nperhaps I shouldn\u2019t neither. Ten pounds is a lot of money: it makes a\nman feel prudent like; and then goodbye to happiness. You give me what\nI ask you, Governor: not a penny more, and not a penny less.\n\nPICKERING. Why don\u2019t you marry that missus of yours? I rather draw the\nline at encouraging that sort of immorality.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Tell her so, Governor: tell her so. I\u2019m willing. It\u2019s me\nthat suffers by it. I\u2019ve no hold on her. I got to be agreeable to her.\nI got to give her presents. I got to buy her clothes something sinful.\nI\u2019m a slave to that woman, Governor, just because I\u2019m not her lawful\nhusband. And she knows it too. Catch her marrying me! Take my advice,\nGovernor: marry Eliza while she\u2019s young and don\u2019t know no better. If\nyou don\u2019t you\u2019ll be sorry for it after. If you do, she\u2019ll be sorry for\nit after; but better you than her, because you\u2019re a man, and she\u2019s only\na woman and don\u2019t know how to be happy anyhow.\n\nHIGGINS. Pickering: if we listen to this man another minute, we shall\nhave no convictions left. [To Doolittle] Five pounds I think you said.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Thank you kindly, Governor.\n\nHIGGINS. You\u2019re sure you won\u2019t take ten?\n\nDOOLITTLE. Not now. Another time, Governor.\n\nHIGGINS [handing him a five-pound note] Here you are.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Thank you, Governor. Good morning.\n\n[He hurries to the door, anxious to get away with his booty. When he\nopens it he is confronted with a dainty and exquisitely clean young\nJapanese lady in a simple blue cotton kimono printed cunningly with\nsmall white jasmine blossoms. Mrs. Pearce is with her. He gets out of\nher way deferentially and apologizes]. Beg pardon, miss.\n\nTHE JAPANESE LADY. Garn! Don\u2019t you know your own daughter?\n\n  DOOLITTLE   {exclaiming  Bly me! it\u2019s Eliza!\n  HIGGINS     {simul-      What\u2019s that! This!\n  PICKERING   {taneously   By Jove!\n\nLIZA. Don\u2019t I look silly?\n\nHIGGINS. Silly?\n\nMRS. PEARCE [at the door] Now, Mr. Higgins, please don\u2019t say anything\nto make the girl conceited about herself.\n\nHIGGINS [conscientiously] Oh! Quite right, Mrs. Pearce. [To Eliza] Yes:\ndamned silly.\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Please, sir.\n\nHIGGINS [correcting himself] I mean extremely silly.\n\nLIZA. I should look all right with my hat on. [She takes up her hat;\nputs it on; and walks across the room to the fireplace with a\nfashionable air].\n\nHIGGINS. A new fashion, by George! And it ought to look horrible!\n\nDOOLITTLE [with fatherly pride] Well, I never thought she\u2019d clean up as\ngood looking as that, Governor. She\u2019s a credit to me, ain\u2019t she?\n\nLIZA. I tell you, it\u2019s easy to clean up here. Hot and cold water on\ntap, just as much as you like, there is. Woolly towels, there is; and a\ntowel horse so hot, it burns your fingers. Soft brushes to scrub\nyourself, and a wooden bowl of soap smelling like primroses. Now I know\nwhy ladies is so clean. Washing\u2019s a treat for them. Wish they saw what\nit is for the like of me!\n\nHIGGINS. I\u2019m glad the bath-room met with your approval.\n\nLIZA. It didn\u2019t: not all of it; and I don\u2019t care who hears me say it.\nMrs. Pearce knows.\n\nHIGGINS. What was wrong, Mrs. Pearce?\n\nMRS. PEARCE [blandly] Oh, nothing, sir. It doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nLIZA. I had a good mind to break it. I didn\u2019t know which way to look.\nBut I hung a towel over it, I did.\n\nHIGGINS. Over what?\n\nMRS. PEARCE. Over the looking-glass, sir.\n\nHIGGINS. Doolittle: you have brought your daughter up too strictly.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Me! I never brought her up at all, except to give her a lick\nof a strap now and again. Don\u2019t put it on me, Governor. She ain\u2019t\naccustomed to it, you see: that\u2019s all. But she\u2019ll soon pick up your\nfree-and-easy ways.\n\nLIZA. I\u2019m a good girl, I am; and I won\u2019t pick up no free and easy ways.\n\nHIGGINS. Eliza: if you say again that you\u2019re a good girl, your father\nshall take you home.\n\nLIZA. Not him. You don\u2019t know my father. All he come here for was to\ntouch you for some money to get drunk on.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Well, what else would I want money for? To put into the\nplate in church, I suppose. [She puts out her tongue at him. He is so\nincensed by this that Pickering presently finds it necessary to step\nbetween them]. Don\u2019t you give me none of your lip; and don\u2019t let me\nhear you giving this gentleman any of it neither, or you\u2019ll hear from\nme about it. See?\n\nHIGGINS. Have you any further advice to give her before you go,\nDoolittle? Your blessing, for instance.\n\nDOOLITTLE. No, Governor: I ain\u2019t such a mug as to put up my children to\nall I know myself. Hard enough to hold them in without that. If you\nwant Eliza\u2019s mind improved, Governor, you do it yourself with a strap.\nSo long, gentlemen. [He turns to go].\n\nHIGGINS [impressively] Stop. You\u2019ll come regularly to see your\ndaughter. It\u2019s your duty, you know. My brother is a clergyman; and he\ncould help you in your talks with her.\n\nDOOLITTLE [evasively] Certainly. I\u2019ll come, Governor. Not just this\nweek, because I have a job at a distance. But later on you may depend\non me. Afternoon, gentlemen. Afternoon, ma\u2019am. [He takes off his hat to\nMrs. Pearce, who disdains the salutation and goes out. He winks at\nHiggins, thinking him probably a fellow sufferer from Mrs. Pearce\u2019s\ndifficult disposition, and follows her].\n\nLIZA. Don\u2019t you believe the old liar. He\u2019d as soon you set a bull-dog\non him as a clergyman. You won\u2019t see him again in a hurry.\n\nHIGGINS. I don\u2019t want to, Eliza. Do you?\n\nLIZA. Not me. I don\u2019t want never to see him again, I don\u2019t. He\u2019s a\ndisgrace to me, he is, collecting dust, instead of working at his trade.\n\nPICKERING. What is his trade, Eliza?\n\nLIZA. Talking money out of other people\u2019s pockets into his own. His\nproper trade\u2019s a navvy; and he works at it sometimes too\u2014for\nexercise\u2014and earns good money at it. Ain\u2019t you going to call me Miss\nDoolittle any more?\n\nPICKERING. I beg your pardon, Miss Doolittle. It was a slip of the\ntongue.\n\nLIZA. Oh, I don\u2019t mind; only it sounded so genteel. I should just like\nto take a taxi to the corner of Tottenham Court Road and get out there\nand tell it to wait for me, just to put the girls in their place a bit.\nI wouldn\u2019t speak to them, you know.\n\nPICKERING. Better wait til we get you something really fashionable.\n\nHIGGINS. Besides, you shouldn\u2019t cut your old friends now that you have\nrisen in the world. That\u2019s what we call snobbery.\n\nLIZA. You don\u2019t call the like of them my friends now, I should hope.\nThey\u2019ve took it out of me often enough with their ridicule when they\nhad the chance; and now I mean to get a bit of my own back. But if I\u2019m\nto have fashionable clothes, I\u2019ll wait. I should like to have some.\nMrs. Pearce says you\u2019re going to give me some to wear in bed at night\ndifferent to what I wear in the daytime; but it do seem a waste of\nmoney when you could get something to show. Besides, I never could\nfancy changing into cold things on a winter night.\n\nMRS. PEARCE [coming back] Now, Eliza. The new things have come for you\nto try on.\n\nLIZA. Ah\u2014ow\u2014oo\u2014ooh! [She rushes out].\n\nMRS. PEARCE [following her] Oh, don\u2019t rush about like that, girl [She\nshuts the door behind her].\n\nHIGGINS. Pickering: we have taken on a stiff job.\n\nPICKERING [with conviction] Higgins: we have.\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\n\nIt is Mrs. Higgins\u2019s at-home day. Nobody has yet arrived. Her\ndrawing-room, in a flat on Chelsea embankment, has three windows\nlooking on the river; and the ceiling is not so lofty as it would be in\nan older house of the same pretension. The windows are open, giving\naccess to a balcony with flowers in pots. If you stand with your face\nto the windows, you have the fireplace on your left and the door in the\nright-hand wall close to the corner nearest the windows.\n\nMrs. Higgins was brought up on Morris and Burne Jones; and her room,\nwhich is very unlike her son\u2019s room in Wimpole Street, is not crowded\nwith furniture and little tables and nicknacks. In the middle of the\nroom there is a big ottoman; and this, with the carpet, the Morris\nwall-papers, and the Morris chintz window curtains and brocade covers\nof the ottoman and its cushions, supply all the ornament, and are much\ntoo handsome to be hidden by odds and ends of useless things. A few\ngood oil-paintings from the exhibitions in the Grosvenor Gallery thirty\nyears ago (the Burne Jones, not the Whistler side of them) are on the\nwalls. The only landscape is a Cecil Lawson on the scale of a Rubens.\nThere is a portrait of Mrs. Higgins as she was when she defied fashion\nin her youth in one of the beautiful Rossettian costumes which, when\ncaricatured by people who did not understand, led to the absurdities of\npopular estheticism in the eighteen-seventies.\n\nIn the corner diagonally opposite the door Mrs. Higgins, now over sixty\nand long past taking the trouble to dress out of the fashion, sits\nwriting at an elegantly simple writing-table with a bell button within\nreach of her hand. There is a Chippendale chair further back in the\nroom between her and the window nearest her side. At the other side of\nthe room, further forward, is an Elizabethan chair roughly carved in\nthe taste of Inigo Jones. On the same side a piano in a decorated case.\nThe corner between the fireplace and the window is occupied by a divan\ncushioned in Morris chintz.\n\nIt is between four and five in the afternoon.\n\nThe door is opened violently; and Higgins enters with his hat on.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [dismayed] Henry [scolding him]! What are you doing here\nto-day? It is my at home day: you promised not to come. [As he bends to\nkiss her, she takes his hat off, and presents it to him].\n\nHIGGINS. Oh bother! [He throws the hat down on the table].\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Go home at once.\n\nHIGGINS [kissing her] I know, mother. I came on purpose.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. But you mustn\u2019t. I\u2019m serious, Henry. You offend all my\nfriends: they stop coming whenever they meet you.\n\nHIGGINS. Nonsense! I know I have no small talk; but people don\u2019t mind.\n[He sits on the settee].\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Oh! don\u2019t they? Small talk indeed! What about your large\ntalk? Really, dear, you mustn\u2019t stay.\n\nHIGGINS. I must. I\u2019ve a job for you. A phonetic job.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. No use, dear. I\u2019m sorry; but I can\u2019t get round your\nvowels; and though I like to get pretty postcards in your patent\nshorthand, I always have to read the copies in ordinary writing you so\nthoughtfully send me.\n\nHIGGINS. Well, this isn\u2019t a phonetic job.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. You said it was.\n\nHIGGINS. Not your part of it. I\u2019ve picked up a girl.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Does that mean that some girl has picked you up?\n\nHIGGINS. Not at all. I don\u2019t mean a love affair.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. What a pity!\n\nHIGGINS. Why?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Well, you never fall in love with anyone under\nforty-five. When will you discover that there are some rather\nnice-looking young women about?\n\nHIGGINS. Oh, I can\u2019t be bothered with young women. My idea of a\nloveable woman is something as like you as possible. I shall never get\ninto the way of seriously liking young women: some habits lie too deep\nto be changed. [Rising abruptly and walking about, jingling his money\nand his keys in his trouser pockets] Besides, they\u2019re all idiots.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Do you know what you would do if you really loved me,\nHenry?\n\nHIGGINS. Oh bother! What? Marry, I suppose?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. No. Stop fidgeting and take your hands out of your\npockets. [With a gesture of despair, he obeys and sits down again].\nThat\u2019s a good boy. Now tell me about the girl.\n\nHIGGINS. She\u2019s coming to see you.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. I don\u2019t remember asking her.\n\nHIGGINS. You didn\u2019t. I asked her. If you\u2019d known her you wouldn\u2019t have\nasked her.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Indeed! Why?\n\nHIGGINS. Well, it\u2019s like this. She\u2019s a common flower girl. I picked her\noff the kerbstone.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. And invited her to my at-home!\n\nHIGGINS [rising and coming to her to coax her] Oh, that\u2019ll be all\nright. I\u2019ve taught her to speak properly; and she has strict orders as\nto her behavior. She\u2019s to keep to two subjects: the weather and\neverybody\u2019s health\u2014Fine day and How do you do, you know\u2014and not to\nlet herself go on things in general. That will be safe.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Safe! To talk about our health! about our insides!\nperhaps about our outsides! How could you be so silly, Henry?\n\nHIGGINS [impatiently] Well, she must talk about something. [He controls\nhimself and sits down again]. Oh, she\u2019ll be all right: don\u2019t you fuss.\nPickering is in it with me. I\u2019ve a sort of bet on that I\u2019ll pass her\noff as a duchess in six months. I started on her some months ago; and\nshe\u2019s getting on like a house on fire. I shall win my bet. She has a\nquick ear; and she\u2019s been easier to teach than my middle-class pupils\nbecause she\u2019s had to learn a complete new language. She talks English\nalmost as you talk French.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. That\u2019s satisfactory, at all events.\n\nHIGGINS. Well, it is and it isn\u2019t.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. What does that mean?\n\nHIGGINS. You see, I\u2019ve got her pronunciation all right; but you have to\nconsider not only how a girl pronounces, but what she pronounces; and\nthat\u2019s where\u2014\n\nThey are interrupted by the parlor-maid, announcing guests.\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID. Mrs. and Miss Eynsford Hill. [She withdraws].\n\nHIGGINS. Oh Lord! [He rises; snatches his hat from the table; and makes\nfor the door; but before he reaches it his mother introduces him].\n\nMrs. and Miss Eynsford Hill are the mother and daughter who sheltered\nfrom the rain in Covent Garden. The mother is well bred, quiet, and has\nthe habitual anxiety of straitened means. The daughter has acquired a\ngay air of being very much at home in society: the bravado of genteel\npoverty.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [to Mrs. Higgins] How do you do? [They shake hands].\n\nMISS EYNSFORD HILL. How d\u2019you do? [She shakes].\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [introducing] My son Henry.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. Your celebrated son! I have so longed to meet you,\nProfessor Higgins.\n\nHIGGINS [glumly, making no movement in her direction] Delighted. [He\nbacks against the piano and bows brusquely].\n\nMiss EYNSFORD HILL [going to him with confident familiarity] How do you\ndo?\n\nHIGGINS [staring at her] I\u2019ve seen you before somewhere. I haven\u2019t the\nghost of a notion where; but I\u2019ve heard your voice. [Drearily] It\ndoesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019d better sit down.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. I\u2019m sorry to say that my celebrated son has no manners.\nYou mustn\u2019t mind him.\n\nMISS EYNSFORD HILL [gaily] I don\u2019t. [She sits in the Elizabethan chair].\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [a little bewildered] Not at all. [She sits on the\nottoman between her daughter and Mrs. Higgins, who has turned her chair\naway from the writing-table].\n\nHIGGINS. Oh, have I been rude? I didn\u2019t mean to be. [He goes to the\ncentral window, through which, with his back to the company, he\ncontemplates the river and the flowers in Battersea Park on the\nopposite bank as if they were a frozen dessert.]\n\nThe parlor-maid returns, ushering in Pickering.\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID. Colonel Pickering [She withdraws].\n\nPICKERING. How do you do, Mrs. Higgins?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. So glad you\u2019ve come. Do you know Mrs. Eynsford Hill\u2014Miss\nEynsford Hill? [Exchange of bows. The Colonel brings the Chippendale\nchair a little forward between Mrs. Hill and Mrs. Higgins, and sits\ndown].\n\nPICKERING. Has Henry told you what we\u2019ve come for?\n\nHIGGINS [over his shoulder] We were interrupted: damn it!\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Oh Henry, Henry, really!\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [half rising] Are we in the way?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [rising and making her sit down again] No, no. You\ncouldn\u2019t have come more fortunately: we want you to meet a friend of\nours.\n\nHIGGINS [turning hopefully] Yes, by George! We want two or three\npeople. You\u2019ll do as well as anybody else.\n\nThe parlor-maid returns, ushering Freddy.\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID. Mr. Eynsford Hill.\n\nHIGGINS [almost audibly, past endurance] God of Heaven! another of them.\n\nFREDDY [shaking hands with Mrs. Higgins] Ahdedo?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Very good of you to come. [Introducing] Colonel Pickering.\n\nFREDDY [bowing] Ahdedo?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. I don\u2019t think you know my son, Professor Higgins.\n\nFREDDY [going to Higgins] Ahdedo?\n\nHIGGINS [looking at him much as if he were a pickpocket] I\u2019ll take my\noath I\u2019ve met you before somewhere. Where was it?\n\nFREDDY. I don\u2019t think so.\n\nHIGGINS [resignedly] It don\u2019t matter, anyhow. Sit down. He shakes\nFreddy\u2019s hand, and almost slings him on the ottoman with his face to\nthe windows; then comes round to the other side of it.\n\nHIGGINS. Well, here we are, anyhow! [He sits down on the ottoman next\nMrs. Eynsford Hill, on her left.] And now, what the devil are we going\nto talk about until Eliza comes?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Henry: you are the life and soul of the Royal Society\u2019s\nsoirees; but really you\u2019re rather trying on more commonplace occasions.\n\nHIGGINS. Am I? Very sorry. [Beaming suddenly] I suppose I am, you know.\n[Uproariously] Ha, ha!\n\nMISS EYNSFORD HILL [who considers Higgins quite eligible matrimonially]\nI sympathize. I haven\u2019t any small talk. If people would only be frank\nand say what they really think!\n\nHIGGINS [relapsing into gloom] Lord forbid!\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [taking up her daughter\u2019s cue] But why?\n\nHIGGINS. What they think they ought to think is bad enough, Lord knows;\nbut what they really think would break up the whole show. Do you\nsuppose it would be really agreeable if I were to come out now with\nwhat I really think?\n\nMISS EYNSFORD HILL [gaily] Is it so very cynical?\n\nHIGGINS. Cynical! Who the dickens said it was cynical? I mean it\nwouldn\u2019t be decent.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [seriously] Oh! I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t mean that, Mr.\nHiggins.\n\nHIGGINS. You see, we\u2019re all savages, more or less. We\u2019re supposed to be\ncivilized and cultured\u2014to know all about poetry and philosophy and art\nand science, and so on; but how many of us know even the meanings of\nthese names? [To Miss Hill] What do you know of poetry? [To Mrs. Hill]\nWhat do you know of science? [Indicating Freddy] What does he know of\nart or science or anything else? What the devil do you imagine I know\nof philosophy?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [warningly] Or of manners, Henry?\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID [opening the door] Miss Doolittle. [She withdraws].\n\nHIGGINS [rising hastily and running to Mrs. Higgins] Here she is,\nmother. [He stands on tiptoe and makes signs over his mother\u2019s head to\nEliza to indicate to her which lady is her hostess].\n\nEliza, who is exquisitely dressed, produces an impression of such\nremarkable distinction and beauty as she enters that they all rise,\nquite flustered. Guided by Higgins\u2019s signals, she comes to Mrs. Higgins\nwith studied grace.\n\nLIZA [speaking with pedantic correctness of pronunciation and great\nbeauty of tone] How do you do, Mrs. Higgins? [She gasps slightly in\nmaking sure of the H in Higgins, but is quite successful]. Mr. Higgins\ntold me I might come.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [cordially] Quite right: I\u2019m very glad indeed to see you.\n\nPICKERING. How do you do, Miss Doolittle?\n\nLIZA [shaking hands with him] Colonel Pickering, is it not?\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. I feel sure we have met before, Miss Doolittle. I\nremember your eyes.\n\nLIZA. How do you do? [She sits down on the ottoman gracefully in the\nplace just left vacant by Higgins].\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [introducing] My daughter Clara.\n\nLIZA. How do you do?\n\nCLARA [impulsively] How do you do? [She sits down on the ottoman beside\nEliza, devouring her with her eyes].\n\nFREDDY [coming to their side of the ottoman] I\u2019ve certainly had the\npleasure.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [introducing] My son Freddy.\n\nLIZA. How do you do?\n\nFreddy bows and sits down in the Elizabethan chair, infatuated.\n\nHIGGINS [suddenly] By George, yes: it all comes back to me! [They stare\nat him]. Covent Garden! [Lamentably] What a damned thing!\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Henry, please! [He is about to sit on the edge of the\ntable]. Don\u2019t sit on my writing-table: you\u2019ll break it.\n\nHIGGINS [sulkily] Sorry.\n\nHe goes to the divan, stumbling into the fender and over the fire-irons\non his way; extricating himself with muttered imprecations; and\nfinishing his disastrous journey by throwing himself so impatiently on\nthe divan that he almost breaks it. Mrs. Higgins looks at him, but\ncontrols herself and says nothing.\n\nA long and painful pause ensues.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [at last, conversationally] Will it rain, do you think?\n\nLIZA. The shallow depression in the west of these islands is likely to\nmove slowly in an easterly direction. There are no indications of any\ngreat change in the barometrical situation.\n\nFREDDY. Ha! ha! how awfully funny!\n\nLIZA. What is wrong with that, young man? I bet I got it right.\n\nFREDDY. Killing!\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. I\u2019m sure I hope it won\u2019t turn cold. There\u2019s so much\ninfluenza about. It runs right through our whole family regularly every\nspring.\n\nLIZA [darkly] My aunt died of influenza: so they said.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [clicks her tongue sympathetically]!!!\n\nLIZA [in the same tragic tone] But it\u2019s my belief they done the old\nwoman in.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [puzzled] Done her in?\n\nLIZA. Y-e-e-e-es, Lord love you! Why should she die of influenza? She\ncome through diphtheria right enough the year before. I saw her with my\nown eyes. Fairly blue with it, she was. They all thought she was dead;\nbut my father he kept ladling gin down her throat til she came to so\nsudden that she bit the bowl off the spoon.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [startled] Dear me!\n\nLIZA [piling up the indictment] What call would a woman with that\nstrength in her have to die of influenza? What become of her new straw\nhat that should have come to me? Somebody pinched it; and what I say\nis, them as pinched it done her in.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. What does doing her in mean?\n\nHIGGINS [hastily] Oh, that\u2019s the new small talk. To do a person in\nmeans to kill them.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [to Eliza, horrified] You surely don\u2019t believe that\nyour aunt was killed?\n\nLIZA. Do I not! Them she lived with would have killed her for a\nhat-pin, let alone a hat.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. But it can\u2019t have been right for your father to\npour spirits down her throat like that. It might have killed her.\n\nLIZA. Not her. Gin was mother\u2019s milk to her. Besides, he\u2019d poured so\nmuch down his own throat that he knew the good of it.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. Do you mean that he drank?\n\nLIZA. Drank! My word! Something chronic.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. How dreadful for you!\n\nLIZA. Not a bit. It never did him no harm what I could see. But then he\ndid not keep it up regular. [Cheerfully] On the burst, as you might\nsay, from time to time. And always more agreeable when he had a drop\nin. When he was out of work, my mother used to give him fourpence and\ntell him to go out and not come back until he\u2019d drunk himself cheerful\nand loving-like. There\u2019s lots of women has to make their husbands drunk\nto make them fit to live with. [Now quite at her ease] You see, it\u2019s\nlike this. If a man has a bit of a conscience, it always takes him when\nhe\u2019s sober; and then it makes him low-spirited. A drop of booze just\ntakes that off and makes him happy. [To Freddy, who is in convulsions\nof suppressed laughter] Here! what are you sniggering at?\n\nFREDDY. The new small talk. You do it so awfully well.\n\nLIZA. If I was doing it proper, what was you laughing at? [To Higgins]\nHave I said anything I oughtn\u2019t?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [interposing] Not at all, Miss Doolittle.\n\nLIZA. Well, that\u2019s a mercy, anyhow. [Expansively] What I always say is\u2014\n\nHIGGINS [rising and looking at his watch] Ahem!\n\nLIZA [looking round at him; taking the hint; and rising] Well: I must\ngo. [They all rise. Freddy goes to the door]. So pleased to have met\nyou. Good-bye. [She shakes hands with Mrs. Higgins].\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Good-bye.\n\nLIZA. Good-bye, Colonel Pickering.\n\nPICKERING. Good-bye, Miss Doolittle. [They shake hands].\n\nLIZA [nodding to the others] Good-bye, all.\n\nFREDDY [opening the door for her] Are you walking across the Park, Miss\nDoolittle? If so\u2014\n\nLIZA. Walk! Not bloody likely. [Sensation]. I am going in a taxi. [She\ngoes out].\n\nPickering gasps and sits down. Freddy goes out on the balcony to catch\nanother glimpse of Eliza.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [suffering from shock] Well, I really can\u2019t get used\nto the new ways.\n\nCLARA [throwing herself discontentedly into the Elizabethan chair]. Oh,\nit\u2019s all right, mamma, quite right. People will think we never go\nanywhere or see anybody if you are so old-fashioned.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. I daresay I am very old-fashioned; but I do hope\nyou won\u2019t begin using that expression, Clara. I have got accustomed to\nhear you talking about men as rotters, and calling everything filthy\nand beastly; though I do think it horrible and unladylike. But this\nlast is really too much. Don\u2019t you think so, Colonel Pickering?\n\nPICKERING. Don\u2019t ask me. I\u2019ve been away in India for several years; and\nmanners have changed so much that I sometimes don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m at\na respectable dinner-table or in a ship\u2019s forecastle.\n\nCLARA. It\u2019s all a matter of habit. There\u2019s no right or wrong in it.\nNobody means anything by it. And it\u2019s so quaint, and gives such a smart\nemphasis to things that are not in themselves very witty. I find the\nnew small talk delightful and quite innocent.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [rising] Well, after that, I think it\u2019s time for us\nto go.\n\nPickering and Higgins rise.\n\nCLARA [rising] Oh yes: we have three at homes to go to still. Good-bye,\nMrs. Higgins. Good-bye, Colonel Pickering. Good-bye, Professor Higgins.\n\nHIGGINS [coming grimly at her from the divan, and accompanying her to\nthe door] Good-bye. Be sure you try on that small talk at the three\nat-homes. Don\u2019t be nervous about it. Pitch it in strong.\n\nCLARA [all smiles] I will. Good-bye. Such nonsense, all this early\nVictorian prudery!\n\nHIGGINS [tempting her] Such damned nonsense!\n\nCLARA. Such bloody nonsense!\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [convulsively] Clara!\n\nCLARA. Ha! ha! [She goes out radiant, conscious of being thoroughly up\nto date, and is heard descending the stairs in a stream of silvery\nlaughter].\n\nFREDDY [to the heavens at large] Well, I ask you [He gives it up, and\ncomes to Mrs. Higgins]. Good-bye.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [shaking hands] Good-bye. Would you like to meet Miss\nDoolittle again?\n\nFREDDY [eagerly] Yes, I should, most awfully.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Well, you know my days.\n\nFREDDY. Yes. Thanks awfully. Good-bye. [He goes out].\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. Good-bye, Mr. Higgins.\n\nHIGGINS. Good-bye. Good-bye.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [to Pickering] It\u2019s no use. I shall never be able to\nbring myself to use that word.\n\nPICKERING. Don\u2019t. It\u2019s not compulsory, you know. You\u2019ll get on quite\nwell without it.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. Only, Clara is so down on me if I am not positively\nreeking with the latest slang. Good-bye.\n\nPICKERING. Good-bye [They shake hands].\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL [to Mrs. Higgins] You mustn\u2019t mind Clara.\n[Pickering, catching from her lowered tone that this is not meant for\nhim to hear, discreetly joins Higgins at the window]. We\u2019re so poor!\nand she gets so few parties, poor child! She doesn\u2019t quite know. [Mrs.\nHiggins, seeing that her eyes are moist, takes her hand sympathetically\nand goes with her to the door]. But the boy is nice. Don\u2019t you think so?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Oh, quite nice. I shall always be delighted to see him.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. Thank you, dear. Good-bye. [She goes out].\n\nHIGGINS [eagerly] Well? Is Eliza presentable [he swoops on his mother\nand drags her to the ottoman, where she sits down in Eliza\u2019s place with\nher son on her left]?\n\nPickering returns to his chair on her right.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. You silly boy, of course she\u2019s not presentable. She\u2019s a\ntriumph of your art and of her dressmaker\u2019s; but if you suppose for a\nmoment that she doesn\u2019t give herself away in every sentence she utters,\nyou must be perfectly cracked about her.\n\nPICKERING. But don\u2019t you think something might be done? I mean\nsomething to eliminate the sanguinary element from her conversation.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Not as long as she is in Henry\u2019s hands.\n\nHIGGINS [aggrieved] Do you mean that my language is improper?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. No, dearest: it would be quite proper\u2014say on a canal\nbarge; but it would not be proper for her at a garden party.\n\nHIGGINS [deeply injured] Well I must say\u2014\n\nPICKERING [interrupting him] Come, Higgins: you must learn to know\nyourself. I haven\u2019t heard such language as yours since we used to\nreview the volunteers in Hyde Park twenty years ago.\n\nHIGGINS [sulkily] Oh, well, if you say so, I suppose I don\u2019t always\ntalk like a bishop.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [quieting Henry with a touch] Colonel Pickering: will you\ntell me what is the exact state of things in Wimpole Street?\n\nPICKERING [cheerfully: as if this completely changed the subject] Well,\nI have come to live there with Henry. We work together at my Indian\nDialects; and we think it more convenient\u2014\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Quite so. I know all about that: it\u2019s an excellent\narrangement. But where does this girl live?\n\nHIGGINS. With us, of course. Where would she live?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. But on what terms? Is she a servant? If not, what is she?\n\nPICKERING [slowly] I think I know what you mean, Mrs. Higgins.\n\nHIGGINS. Well, dash me if I do! I\u2019ve had to work at the girl every day\nfor months to get her to her present pitch. Besides, she\u2019s useful. She\nknows where my things are, and remembers my appointments and so forth.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. How does your housekeeper get on with her?\n\nHIGGINS. Mrs. Pearce? Oh, she\u2019s jolly glad to get so much taken off her\nhands; for before Eliza came, she had to have to find things and remind\nme of my appointments. But she\u2019s got some silly bee in her bonnet about\nEliza. She keeps saying \u201cYou don\u2019t think, sir\u201d: doesn\u2019t she, Pick?\n\nPICKERING. Yes: that\u2019s the formula. \u201cYou don\u2019t think, sir.\u201d That\u2019s the\nend of every conversation about Eliza.\n\nHIGGINS. As if I ever stop thinking about the girl and her confounded\nvowels and consonants. I\u2019m worn out, thinking about her, and watching\nher lips and her teeth and her tongue, not to mention her soul, which\nis the quaintest of the lot.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. You certainly are a pretty pair of babies, playing with\nyour live doll.\n\nHIGGINS. Playing! The hardest job I ever tackled: make no mistake about\nthat, mother. But you have no idea how frightfully interesting it is to\ntake a human being and change her into a quite different human being by\ncreating a new speech for her. It\u2019s filling up the deepest gulf that\nseparates class from class and soul from soul.\n\nPICKERING [drawing his chair closer to Mrs. Higgins and bending over to\nher eagerly] Yes: it\u2019s enormously interesting. I assure you, Mrs.\nHiggins, we take Eliza very seriously. Every week\u2014every day\nalmost\u2014there is some new change. [Closer again] We keep records of\nevery stage\u2014dozens of gramophone disks and photographs\u2014\n\nHIGGINS [assailing her at the other ear] Yes, by George: it\u2019s the most\nabsorbing experiment I ever tackled. She regularly fills our lives up;\ndoesn\u2019t she, Pick?\n\nPICKERING. We\u2019re always talking Eliza.\n\nHIGGINS. Teaching Eliza.\n\nPICKERING. Dressing Eliza.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. What!\n\nHIGGINS. Inventing new Elizas.\n\nHiggins and Pickering, speaking together:\n\n  HIGGINS.    You know, she has the most extraordinary quickness of ear:\n  PICKERING.  I assure you, my dear Mrs. Higgins, that girl\n  HIGGINS.    just like a parrot. I\u2019ve tried her with every\n  PICKERING.  is a genius. She can play the piano quite beautifully\n  HIGGINS.    possible sort of sound that a human being can make\u2014\n  PICKERING.  We have taken her to classical concerts and to music\n  HIGGINS.    Continental dialects, African dialects, Hottentot\n  PICKERING.  halls; and it\u2019s all the same to her: she plays everything\n  HIGGINS.    clicks, things it took me years to get hold of; and\n  PICKERING.  she hears right off when she comes home, whether it\u2019s\n  HIGGINS.    she picks them up like a shot, right away, as if she had\n  PICKERING.  Beethoven and Brahms or Lehar and Lionel Morickton;\n  HIGGINS.    been at it all her life.\n  PICKERING.  though six months ago, she\u2019d never as much as touched\n              a piano.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [putting her fingers in her ears, as they are by this time\nshouting one another down with an intolerable noise] Sh\u2014sh\u2014sh\u2014sh!\n[They stop].\n\nPICKERING. I beg your pardon. [He draws his chair back apologetically].\n\nHIGGINS. Sorry. When Pickering starts shouting nobody can get a word in\nedgeways.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Be quiet, Henry. Colonel Pickering: don\u2019t you realize\nthat when Eliza walked into Wimpole Street, something walked in with\nher?\n\nPICKERING. Her father did. But Henry soon got rid of him.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. It would have been more to the point if her mother had.\nBut as her mother didn\u2019t something else did.\n\nPICKERING. But what?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [unconsciously dating herself by the word] A problem.\n\nPICKERING. Oh, I see. The problem of how to pass her off as a lady.\n\nHIGGINS. I\u2019ll solve that problem. I\u2019ve half solved it already.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. No, you two infinitely stupid male creatures: the problem\nof what is to be done with her afterwards.\n\nHIGGINS. I don\u2019t see anything in that. She can go her own way, with all\nthe advantages I have given her.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. The advantages of that poor woman who was here just now!\nThe manners and habits that disqualify a fine lady from earning her own\nliving without giving her a fine lady\u2019s income! Is that what you mean?\n\nPICKERING [indulgently, being rather bored] Oh, that will be all right,\nMrs. Higgins. [He rises to go].\n\nHIGGINS [rising also] We\u2019ll find her some light employment.\n\nPICKERING. She\u2019s happy enough. Don\u2019t you worry about her. Good-bye. [He\nshakes hands as if he were consoling a frightened child, and makes for\nthe door].\n\nHIGGINS. Anyhow, there\u2019s no good bothering now. The thing\u2019s done.\nGood-bye, mother. [He kisses her, and follows Pickering].\n\nPICKERING [turning for a final consolation] There are plenty of\nopenings. We\u2019ll do what\u2019s right. Good-bye.\n\nHIGGINS [to Pickering as they go out together] Let\u2019s take her to the\nShakespear exhibition at Earls Court.\n\nPICKERING. Yes: let\u2019s. Her remarks will be delicious.\n\nHIGGINS. She\u2019ll mimic all the people for us when we get home.\n\nPICKERING. Ripping. [Both are heard laughing as they go downstairs].\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [rises with an impatient bounce, and returns to her work\nat the writing-table. She sweeps a litter of disarranged papers out of\nher way; snatches a sheet of paper from her stationery case; and tries\nresolutely to write. At the third line she gives it up; flings down her\npen; grips the table angrily and exclaims] Oh, men! men!! men!!!\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\n\nThe Wimpole Street laboratory. Midnight. Nobody in the room. The clock\non the mantelpiece strikes twelve. The fire is not alight: it is a\nsummer night.\n\nPresently Higgins and Pickering are heard on the stairs.\n\nHIGGINS [calling down to Pickering] I say, Pick: lock up, will you. I\nshan\u2019t be going out again.\n\nPICKERING. Right. Can Mrs. Pearce go to bed? We don\u2019t want anything\nmore, do we?\n\nHIGGINS. Lord, no!\n\nEliza opens the door and is seen on the lighted landing in opera cloak,\nbrilliant evening dress, and diamonds, with fan, flowers, and all\naccessories. She comes to the hearth, and switches on the electric\nlights there. She is tired: her pallor contrasts strongly with her dark\neyes and hair; and her expression is almost tragic. She takes off her\ncloak; puts her fan and flowers on the piano; and sits down on the\nbench, brooding and silent. Higgins, in evening dress, with overcoat\nand hat, comes in, carrying a smoking jacket which he has picked up\ndownstairs. He takes off the hat and overcoat; throws them carelessly\non the newspaper stand; disposes of his coat in the same way; puts on\nthe smoking jacket; and throws himself wearily into the easy-chair at\nthe hearth. Pickering, similarly attired, comes in. He also takes off\nhis hat and overcoat, and is about to throw them on Higgins\u2019s when he\nhesitates.\n\nPICKERING. I say: Mrs. Pearce will row if we leave these things lying\nabout in the drawing-room.\n\nHIGGINS. Oh, chuck them over the bannisters into the hall. She\u2019ll find\nthem there in the morning and put them away all right. She\u2019ll think we\nwere drunk.\n\nPICKERING. We are, slightly. Are there any letters?\n\nHIGGINS. I didn\u2019t look. [Pickering takes the overcoats and hats and\ngoes down stairs. Higgins begins half singing half yawning an air from\nLa Fanciulla del Golden West. Suddenly he stops and exclaims] I wonder\nwhere the devil my slippers are!\n\nEliza looks at him darkly; then leaves the room.\n\nHiggins yawns again, and resumes his song. Pickering returns, with the\ncontents of the letter-box in his hand.\n\nPICKERING. Only circulars, and this coroneted billet-doux for you. [He\nthrows the circulars into the fender, and posts himself on the\nhearthrug, with his back to the grate].\n\nHIGGINS [glancing at the billet-doux] Money-lender. [He throws the\nletter after the circulars].\n\nEliza returns with a pair of large down-at-heel slippers. She places\nthem on the carpet before Higgins, and sits as before without a word.\n\nHIGGINS [yawning again] Oh Lord! What an evening! What a crew! What a\nsilly tomfoollery! [He raises his shoe to unlace it, and catches sight\nof the slippers. He stops unlacing and looks at them as if they had\nappeared there of their own accord]. Oh! they\u2019re there, are they?\n\nPICKERING [stretching himself] Well, I feel a bit tired. It\u2019s been a\nlong day. The garden party, a dinner party, and the opera! Rather too\nmuch of a good thing. But you\u2019ve won your bet, Higgins. Eliza did the\ntrick, and something to spare, eh?\n\nHIGGINS [fervently] Thank God it\u2019s over!\n\nEliza flinches violently; but they take no notice of her; and she\nrecovers herself and sits stonily as before.\n\nPICKERING. Were you nervous at the garden party? I was. Eliza didn\u2019t\nseem a bit nervous.\n\nHIGGINS. Oh, she wasn\u2019t nervous. I knew she\u2019d be all right. No, it\u2019s\nthe strain of putting the job through all these months that has told on\nme. It was interesting enough at first, while we were at the phonetics;\nbut after that I got deadly sick of it. If I hadn\u2019t backed myself to do\nit I should have chucked the whole thing up two months ago. It was a\nsilly notion: the whole thing has been a bore.\n\nPICKERING. Oh come! the garden party was frightfully exciting. My heart\nbegan beating like anything.\n\nHIGGINS. Yes, for the first three minutes. But when I saw we were going\nto win hands down, I felt like a bear in a cage, hanging about doing\nnothing. The dinner was worse: sitting gorging there for over an hour,\nwith nobody but a damned fool of a fashionable woman to talk to! I tell\nyou, Pickering, never again for me. No more artificial duchesses. The\nwhole thing has been simple purgatory.\n\nPICKERING. You\u2019ve never been broken in properly to the social routine.\n[Strolling over to the piano] I rather enjoy dipping into it\noccasionally myself: it makes me feel young again. Anyhow, it was a\ngreat success: an immense success. I was quite frightened once or twice\nbecause Eliza was doing it so well. You see, lots of the real people\ncan\u2019t do it at all: they\u2019re such fools that they think style comes by\nnature to people in their position; and so they never learn. There\u2019s\nalways something professional about doing a thing superlatively well.\n\nHIGGINS. Yes: that\u2019s what drives me mad: the silly people don\u2019t know\ntheir own silly business. [Rising] However, it\u2019s over and done with;\nand now I can go to bed at last without dreading tomorrow.\n\nEliza\u2019s beauty becomes murderous.\n\nPICKERING. I think I shall turn in too. Still, it\u2019s been a great\noccasion: a triumph for you. Good-night. [He goes].\n\nHIGGINS [following him] Good-night. [Over his shoulder, at the door]\nPut out the lights, Eliza; and tell Mrs. Pearce not to make coffee for\nme in the morning: I\u2019ll take tea. [He goes out].\n\nEliza tries to control herself and feel indifferent as she rises and\nwalks across to the hearth to switch off the lights. By the time she\ngets there she is on the point of screaming. She sits down in Higgins\u2019s\nchair and holds on hard to the arms. Finally she gives way and flings\nherself furiously on the floor raging.\n\nHIGGINS [in despairing wrath outside] What the devil have I done with\nmy slippers? [He appears at the door].\n\nLIZA [snatching up the slippers, and hurling them at him one after the\nother with all her force] There are your slippers. And there. Take your\nslippers; and may you never have a day\u2019s luck with them!\n\nHIGGINS [astounded] What on earth\u2014! [He comes to her]. What\u2019s the\nmatter? Get up. [He pulls her up]. Anything wrong?\n\nLIZA [breathless] Nothing wrong\u2014with YOU. I\u2019ve won your bet for you,\nhaven\u2019t I? That\u2019s enough for you. _I_ don\u2019t matter, I suppose.\n\nHIGGINS. YOU won my bet! You! Presumptuous insect! _I_ won it. What did\nyou throw those slippers at me for?\n\nLIZA. Because I wanted to smash your face. I\u2019d like to kill you, you\nselfish brute. Why didn\u2019t you leave me where you picked me out of\u2014in\nthe gutter? You thank God it\u2019s all over, and that now you can throw me\nback again there, do you? [She crisps her fingers, frantically].\n\nHIGGINS [looking at her in cool wonder] The creature IS nervous, after\nall.\n\nLIZA [gives a suffocated scream of fury, and instinctively darts her\nnails at his face]!!\n\nHIGGINS [catching her wrists] Ah! would you? Claws in, you cat. How\ndare you show your temper to me? Sit down and be quiet. [He throws her\nroughly into the easy-chair].\n\nLIZA [crushed by superior strength and weight] What\u2019s to become of me?\nWhat\u2019s to become of me?\n\nHIGGINS. How the devil do I know what\u2019s to become of you? What does it\nmatter what becomes of you?\n\nLIZA. You don\u2019t care. I know you don\u2019t care. You wouldn\u2019t care if I was\ndead. I\u2019m nothing to you\u2014not so much as them slippers.\n\nHIGGINS [thundering] THOSE slippers.\n\nLIZA [with bitter submission] Those slippers. I didn\u2019t think it made\nany difference now.\n\nA pause. Eliza hopeless and crushed. Higgins a little uneasy.\n\nHIGGINS [in his loftiest manner] Why have you begun going on like this?\nMay I ask whether you complain of your treatment here?\n\nLIZA. No.\n\nHIGGINS. Has anybody behaved badly to you? Colonel Pickering? Mrs.\nPearce? Any of the servants?\n\nLIZA. No.\n\nHIGGINS. I presume you don\u2019t pretend that I have treated you badly.\n\nLIZA. No.\n\nHIGGINS. I am glad to hear it. [He moderates his tone]. Perhaps you\u2019re\ntired after the strain of the day. Will you have a glass of champagne?\n[He moves towards the door].\n\nLIZA. No. [Recollecting her manners] Thank you.\n\nHIGGINS [good-humored again] This has been coming on you for some days.\nI suppose it was natural for you to be anxious about the garden party.\nBut that\u2019s all over now. [He pats her kindly on the shoulder. She\nwrithes]. There\u2019s nothing more to worry about.\n\nLIZA. No. Nothing more for you to worry about. [She suddenly rises and\ngets away from him by going to the piano bench, where she sits and\nhides her face]. Oh God! I wish I was dead.\n\nHIGGINS [staring after her in sincere surprise] Why? in heaven\u2019s name,\nwhy? [Reasonably, going to her] Listen to me, Eliza. All this\nirritation is purely subjective.\n\nLIZA. I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m too ignorant.\n\nHIGGINS. It\u2019s only imagination. Low spirits and nothing else. Nobody\u2019s\nhurting you. Nothing\u2019s wrong. You go to bed like a good girl and sleep\nit off. Have a little cry and say your prayers: that will make you\ncomfortable.\n\nLIZA. I heard YOUR prayers. \u201cThank God it\u2019s all over!\u201d\n\nHIGGINS [impatiently] Well, don\u2019t you thank God it\u2019s all over? Now you\nare free and can do what you like.\n\nLIZA [pulling herself together in desperation] What am I fit for? What\nhave you left me fit for? Where am I to go? What am I to do? What\u2019s to\nbecome of me?\n\nHIGGINS [enlightened, but not at all impressed] Oh, that\u2019s what\u2019s\nworrying you, is it? [He thrusts his hands into his pockets, and walks\nabout in his usual manner, rattling the contents of his pockets, as if\ncondescending to a trivial subject out of pure kindness]. I shouldn\u2019t\nbother about it if I were you. I should imagine you won\u2019t have much\ndifficulty in settling yourself, somewhere or other, though I hadn\u2019t\nquite realized that you were going away. [She looks quickly at him: he\ndoes not look at her, but examines the dessert stand on the piano and\ndecides that he will eat an apple]. You might marry, you know. [He\nbites a large piece out of the apple, and munches it noisily]. You see,\nEliza, all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the Colonel.\nMost men are the marrying sort (poor devils!); and you\u2019re not\nbad-looking; it\u2019s quite a pleasure to look at you sometimes\u2014not now,\nof course, because you\u2019re crying and looking as ugly as the very devil;\nbut when you\u2019re all right and quite yourself, you\u2019re what I should call\nattractive. That is, to the people in the marrying line, you\nunderstand. You go to bed and have a good nice rest; and then get up\nand look at yourself in the glass; and you won\u2019t feel so cheap.\n\nEliza again looks at him, speechless, and does not stir.\n\nThe look is quite lost on him: he eats his apple with a dreamy\nexpression of happiness, as it is quite a good one.\n\nHIGGINS [a genial afterthought occurring to him] I daresay my mother\ncould find some chap or other who would do very well\u2014\n\nLIZA. We were above that at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.\n\nHIGGINS [waking up] What do you mean?\n\nLIZA. I sold flowers. I didn\u2019t sell myself. Now you\u2019ve made a lady of\nme I\u2019m not fit to sell anything else. I wish you\u2019d left me where you\nfound me.\n\nHIGGINS [slinging the core of the apple decisively into the grate]\nTosh, Eliza. Don\u2019t you insult human relations by dragging all this cant\nabout buying and selling into it. You needn\u2019t marry the fellow if you\ndon\u2019t like him.\n\nLIZA. What else am I to do?\n\nHIGGINS. Oh, lots of things. What about your old idea of a florist\u2019s\nshop? Pickering could set you up in one: he\u2019s lots of money.\n[Chuckling] He\u2019ll have to pay for all those togs you have been wearing\ntoday; and that, with the hire of the jewellery, will make a big hole\nin two hundred pounds. Why, six months ago you would have thought it\nthe millennium to have a flower shop of your own. Come! you\u2019ll be all\nright. I must clear off to bed: I\u2019m devilish sleepy. By the way, I came\ndown for something: I forget what it was.\n\nLIZA. Your slippers.\n\nHIGGINS. Oh yes, of course. You shied them at me. [He picks them up,\nand is going out when she rises and speaks to him].\n\nLIZA. Before you go, sir\u2014\n\nHIGGINS [dropping the slippers in his surprise at her calling him sir]\nEh?\n\nLIZA. Do my clothes belong to me or to Colonel Pickering?\n\nHIGGINS [coming back into the room as if her question were the very\nclimax of unreason] What the devil use would they be to Pickering?\n\nLIZA. He might want them for the next girl you pick up to experiment on.\n\nHIGGINS [shocked and hurt] Is THAT the way you feel towards us?\n\nLIZA. I don\u2019t want to hear anything more about that. All I want to know\nis whether anything belongs to me. My own clothes were burnt.\n\nHIGGINS. But what does it matter? Why need you start bothering about\nthat in the middle of the night?\n\nLIZA. I want to know what I may take away with me. I don\u2019t want to be\naccused of stealing.\n\nHIGGINS [now deeply wounded] Stealing! You shouldn\u2019t have said that,\nEliza. That shows a want of feeling.\n\nLIZA. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m only a common ignorant girl; and in my station I\nhave to be careful. There can\u2019t be any feelings between the like of you\nand the like of me. Please will you tell me what belongs to me and what\ndoesn\u2019t?\n\nHIGGINS [very sulky] You may take the whole damned houseful if you\nlike. Except the jewels. They\u2019re hired. Will that satisfy you? [He\nturns on his heel and is about to go in extreme dudgeon].\n\nLIZA [drinking in his emotion like nectar, and nagging him to provoke a\nfurther supply] Stop, please. [She takes off her jewels]. Will you take\nthese to your room and keep them safe? I don\u2019t want to run the risk of\ntheir being missing.\n\nHIGGINS [furious] Hand them over. [She puts them into his hands]. If\nthese belonged to me instead of to the jeweler, I\u2019d ram them down your\nungrateful throat. [He perfunctorily thrusts them into his pockets,\nunconsciously decorating himself with the protruding ends of the\nchains].\n\nLIZA [taking a ring off] This ring isn\u2019t the jeweler\u2019s: it\u2019s the one\nyou bought me in Brighton. I don\u2019t want it now. [Higgins dashes the\nring violently into the fireplace, and turns on her so threateningly\nthat she crouches over the piano with her hands over her face, and\nexclaims] Don\u2019t you hit me.\n\nHIGGINS. Hit you! You infamous creature, how dare you accuse me of such\na thing? It is you who have hit me. You have wounded me to the heart.\n\nLIZA [thrilling with hidden joy] I\u2019m glad. I\u2019ve got a little of my own\nback, anyhow.\n\nHIGGINS [with dignity, in his finest professional style] You have\ncaused me to lose my temper: a thing that has hardly ever happened to\nme before. I prefer to say nothing more tonight. I am going to bed.\n\nLIZA [pertly] You\u2019d better leave a note for Mrs. Pearce about the\ncoffee; for she won\u2019t be told by me.\n\nHIGGINS [formally] Damn Mrs. Pearce; and damn the coffee; and damn you;\nand damn my own folly in having lavished MY hard-earned knowledge and\nthe treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe. [He\ngoes out with impressive decorum, and spoils it by slamming the door\nsavagely].\n\nEliza smiles for the first time; expresses her feelings by a wild\npantomime in which an imitation of Higgins\u2019s exit is confused with her\nown triumph; and finally goes down on her knees on the hearthrug to\nlook for the ring.\n\n\n\n\nACT V\n\n\nMrs. Higgins\u2019s drawing-room. She is at her writing-table as before. The\nparlor-maid comes in.\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID [at the door] Mr. Henry, mam, is downstairs with\nColonel Pickering.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Well, show them up.\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID. They\u2019re using the telephone, mam. Telephoning to the\npolice, I think.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. What!\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID [coming further in and lowering her voice] Mr. Henry\u2019s\nin a state, mam. I thought I\u2019d better tell you.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. If you had told me that Mr. Henry was not in a state it\nwould have been more surprising. Tell them to come up when they\u2019ve\nfinished with the police. I suppose he\u2019s lost something.\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID. Yes, maam [going].\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Go upstairs and tell Miss Doolittle that Mr. Henry and\nthe Colonel are here. Ask her not to come down till I send for her.\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID. Yes, mam.\n\nHiggins bursts in. He is, as the parlor-maid has said, in a state.\n\nHIGGINS. Look here, mother: here\u2019s a confounded thing!\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Yes, dear. Good-morning. [He checks his impatience and\nkisses her, whilst the parlor-maid goes out]. What is it?\n\nHIGGINS. Eliza\u2019s bolted.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [calmly continuing her writing] You must have frightened\nher.\n\nHIGGINS. Frightened her! nonsense! She was left last night, as usual,\nto turn out the lights and all that; and instead of going to bed she\nchanged her clothes and went right off: her bed wasn\u2019t slept in. She\ncame in a cab for her things before seven this morning; and that fool\nMrs. Pearce let her have them without telling me a word about it. What\nam I to do?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Do without, I\u2019m afraid, Henry. The girl has a perfect\nright to leave if she chooses.\n\nHIGGINS [wandering distractedly across the room] But I can\u2019t find\nanything. I don\u2019t know what appointments I\u2019ve got. I\u2019m\u2014 [Pickering\ncomes in. Mrs. Higgins puts down her pen and turns away from the\nwriting-table].\n\nPICKERING [shaking hands] Good-morning, Mrs. Higgins. Has Henry told\nyou? [He sits down on the ottoman].\n\nHIGGINS. What does that ass of an inspector say? Have you offered a\nreward?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [rising in indignant amazement] You don\u2019t mean to say you\nhave set the police after Eliza?\n\nHIGGINS. Of course. What are the police for? What else could we do? [He\nsits in the Elizabethan chair].\n\nPICKERING. The inspector made a lot of difficulties. I really think he\nsuspected us of some improper purpose.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Well, of course he did. What right have you to go to the\npolice and give the girl\u2019s name as if she were a thief, or a lost\numbrella, or something? Really! [She sits down again, deeply vexed].\n\nHIGGINS. But we want to find her.\n\nPICKERING. We can\u2019t let her go like this, you know, Mrs. Higgins. What\nwere we to do?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. You have no more sense, either of you, than two children.\nWhy\u2014\n\nThe parlor-maid comes in and breaks off the conversation.\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID. Mr. Henry: a gentleman wants to see you very\nparticular. He\u2019s been sent on from Wimpole Street.\n\nHIGGINS. Oh, bother! I can\u2019t see anyone now. Who is it?\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID. A Mr. Doolittle, Sir.\n\nPICKERING. Doolittle! Do you mean the dustman?\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID. Dustman! Oh no, sir: a gentleman.\n\nHIGGINS [springing up excitedly] By George, Pick, it\u2019s some relative of\nhers that she\u2019s gone to. Somebody we know nothing about. [To the\nparlor-maid] Send him up, quick.\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID. Yes, Sir. [She goes].\n\nHIGGINS [eagerly, going to his mother] Genteel relatives! now we shall\nhear something. [He sits down in the Chippendale chair].\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Do you know any of her people?\n\nPICKERING. Only her father: the fellow we told you about.\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID [announcing] Mr. Doolittle. [She withdraws].\n\nDoolittle enters. He is brilliantly dressed in a new fashionable\nfrock-coat, with white waistcoat and grey trousers. A flower in his\nbuttonhole, a dazzling silk hat, and patent leather shoes complete the\neffect. He is too concerned with the business he has come on to notice\nMrs. Higgins. He walks straight to Higgins, and accosts him with\nvehement reproach.\n\nDOOLITTLE [indicating his own person] See here! Do you see this? You\ndone this.\n\nHIGGINS. Done what, man?\n\nDOOLITTLE. This, I tell you. Look at it. Look at this hat. Look at this\ncoat.\n\nPICKERING. Has Eliza been buying you clothes?\n\nDOOLITTLE. Eliza! not she. Not half. Why would she buy me clothes?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Good-morning, Mr. Doolittle. Won\u2019t you sit down?\n\nDOOLITTLE [taken aback as he becomes conscious that he has forgotten\nhis hostess] Asking your pardon, ma\u2019am. [He approaches her and shakes\nher proffered hand]. Thank you. [He sits down on the ottoman, on\nPickering\u2019s right]. I am that full of what has happened to me that I\ncan\u2019t think of anything else.\n\nHIGGINS. What the dickens has happened to you?\n\nDOOLITTLE. I shouldn\u2019t mind if it had only happened to me: anything\nmight happen to anybody and nobody to blame but Providence, as you\nmight say. But this is something that you done to me: yes, you, Henry\nHiggins.\n\nHIGGINS. Have you found Eliza? That\u2019s the point.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Have you lost her?\n\nHIGGINS. Yes.\n\nDOOLITTLE. You have all the luck, you have. I ain\u2019t found her; but\nshe\u2019ll find me quick enough now after what you done to me.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. But what has my son done to you, Mr. Doolittle?\n\nDOOLITTLE. Done to me! Ruined me. Destroyed my happiness. Tied me up\nand delivered me into the hands of middle class morality.\n\nHIGGINS [rising intolerantly and standing over Doolittle] You\u2019re\nraving. You\u2019re drunk. You\u2019re mad. I gave you five pounds. After that I\nhad two conversations with you, at half-a-crown an hour. I\u2019ve never\nseen you since.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Oh! Drunk! am I? Mad! am I? Tell me this. Did you or did you\nnot write a letter to an old blighter in America that was giving five\nmillions to found Moral Reform Societies all over the world, and that\nwanted you to invent a universal language for him?\n\nHIGGINS. What! Ezra D. Wannafeller! He\u2019s dead. [He sits down again\ncarelessly].\n\nDOOLITTLE. Yes: he\u2019s dead; and I\u2019m done for. Now did you or did you not\nwrite a letter to him to say that the most original moralist at present\nin England, to the best of your knowledge, was Alfred Doolittle, a\ncommon dustman.\n\nHIGGINS. Oh, after your last visit I remember making some silly joke of\nthe kind.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Ah! you may well call it a silly joke. It put the lid on me\nright enough. Just give him the chance he wanted to show that Americans\nis not like us: that they recognize and respect merit in every class of\nlife, however humble. Them words is in his blooming will, in which,\nHenry Higgins, thanks to your silly joking, he leaves me a share in his\nPre-digested Cheese Trust worth three thousand a year on condition that\nI lecture for his Wannafeller Moral Reform World League as often as\nthey ask me up to six times a year.\n\nHIGGINS. The devil he does! Whew! [Brightening suddenly] What a lark!\n\nPICKERING. A safe thing for you, Doolittle. They won\u2019t ask you twice.\n\nDOOLITTLE. It ain\u2019t the lecturing I mind. I\u2019ll lecture them blue in the\nface, I will, and not turn a hair. It\u2019s making a gentleman of me that I\nobject to. Who asked him to make a gentleman of me? I was happy. I was\nfree. I touched pretty nigh everybody for money when I wanted it, same\nas I touched you, Henry Higgins. Now I am worrited; tied neck and\nheels; and everybody touches me for money. It\u2019s a fine thing for you,\nsays my solicitor. Is it? says I. You mean it\u2019s a good thing for you, I\nsays. When I was a poor man and had a solicitor once when they found a\npram in the dust cart, he got me off, and got shut of me and got me\nshut of him as quick as he could. Same with the doctors: used to shove\nme out of the hospital before I could hardly stand on my legs, and\nnothing to pay. Now they finds out that I\u2019m not a healthy man and can\u2019t\nlive unless they looks after me twice a day. In the house I\u2019m not let\ndo a hand\u2019s turn for myself: somebody else must do it and touch me for\nit. A year ago I hadn\u2019t a relative in the world except two or three\nthat wouldn\u2019t speak to me. Now I\u2019ve fifty, and not a decent week\u2019s\nwages among the lot of them. I have to live for others and not for\nmyself: that\u2019s middle class morality. You talk of losing Eliza. Don\u2019t\nyou be anxious: I bet she\u2019s on my doorstep by this: she that could\nsupport herself easy by selling flowers if I wasn\u2019t respectable. And\nthe next one to touch me will be you, Henry Higgins. I\u2019ll have to learn\nto speak middle class language from you, instead of speaking proper\nEnglish. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll come in; and I daresay that\u2019s what you\ndone it for.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. But, my dear Mr. Doolittle, you need not suffer all this\nif you are really in earnest. Nobody can force you to accept this\nbequest. You can repudiate it. Isn\u2019t that so, Colonel Pickering?\n\nPICKERING. I believe so.\n\nDOOLITTLE [softening his manner in deference to her sex] That\u2019s the\ntragedy of it, ma\u2019am. It\u2019s easy to say chuck it; but I haven\u2019t the\nnerve. Which one of us has? We\u2019re all intimidated. Intimidated, ma\u2019am:\nthat\u2019s what we are. What is there for me if I chuck it but the\nworkhouse in my old age? I have to dye my hair already to keep my job\nas a dustman. If I was one of the deserving poor, and had put by a bit,\nI could chuck it; but then why should I, acause the deserving poor\nmight as well be millionaires for all the happiness they ever has. They\ndon\u2019t know what happiness is. But I, as one of the undeserving poor,\nhave nothing between me and the pauper\u2019s uniform but this here blasted\nthree thousand a year that shoves me into the middle class. (Excuse the\nexpression, ma\u2019am: you\u2019d use it yourself if you had my provocation).\nThey\u2019ve got you every way you turn: it\u2019s a choice between the Skilly of\nthe workhouse and the Char Bydis of the middle class; and I haven\u2019t the\nnerve for the workhouse. Intimidated: that\u2019s what I am. Broke. Bought\nup. Happier men than me will call for my dust, and touch me for their\ntip; and I\u2019ll look on helpless, and envy them. And that\u2019s what your son\nhas brought me to. [He is overcome by emotion].\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Well, I\u2019m very glad you\u2019re not going to do anything\nfoolish, Mr. Doolittle. For this solves the problem of Eliza\u2019s future.\nYou can provide for her now.\n\nDOOLITTLE [with melancholy resignation] Yes, ma\u2019am; I\u2019m expected to\nprovide for everyone now, out of three thousand a year.\n\nHIGGINS [jumping up] Nonsense! he can\u2019t provide for her. He shan\u2019t\nprovide for her. She doesn\u2019t belong to him. I paid him five pounds for\nher. Doolittle: either you\u2019re an honest man or a rogue.\n\nDOOLITTLE [tolerantly] A little of both, Henry, like the rest of us: a\nlittle of both.\n\nHIGGINS. Well, you took that money for the girl; and you have no right\nto take her as well.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Henry: don\u2019t be absurd. If you really want to know where\nEliza is, she is upstairs.\n\nHIGGINS [amazed] Upstairs!!! Then I shall jolly soon fetch her\ndownstairs. [He makes resolutely for the door].\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [rising and following him] Be quiet, Henry. Sit down.\n\nHIGGINS. I\u2014\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Sit down, dear; and listen to me.\n\nHIGGINS. Oh very well, very well, very well. [He throws himself\nungraciously on the ottoman, with his face towards the windows]. But I\nthink you might have told me this half an hour ago.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Eliza came to me this morning. She passed the night\npartly walking about in a rage, partly trying to throw herself into the\nriver and being afraid to, and partly in the Carlton Hotel. She told me\nof the brutal way you two treated her.\n\nHIGGINS [bounding up again] What!\n\nPICKERING [rising also] My dear Mrs. Higgins, she\u2019s been telling you\nstories. We didn\u2019t treat her brutally. We hardly said a word to her;\nand we parted on particularly good terms. [Turning on Higgins].\nHiggins: did you bully her after I went to bed?\n\nHIGGINS. Just the other way about. She threw my slippers in my face.\nShe behaved in the most outrageous way. I never gave her the slightest\nprovocation. The slippers came bang into my face the moment I entered\nthe room\u2014before I had uttered a word. And used perfectly awful\nlanguage.\n\nPICKERING [astonished] But why? What did we do to her?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. I think I know pretty well what you did. The girl is\nnaturally rather affectionate, I think. Isn\u2019t she, Mr. Doolittle?\n\nDOOLITTLE. Very tender-hearted, ma\u2019am. Takes after me.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Just so. She had become attached to you both. She worked\nvery hard for you, Henry! I don\u2019t think you quite realize what anything\nin the nature of brain work means to a girl like that. Well, it seems\nthat when the great day of trial came, and she did this wonderful thing\nfor you without making a single mistake, you two sat there and never\nsaid a word to her, but talked together of how glad you were that it\nwas all over and how you had been bored with the whole thing. And then\nyou were surprised because she threw your slippers at you! _I_ should\nhave thrown the fire-irons at you.\n\nHIGGINS. We said nothing except that we were tired and wanted to go to\nbed. Did we, Pick?\n\nPICKERING [shrugging his shoulders] That was all.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [ironically] Quite sure?\n\nPICKERING. Absolutely. Really, that was all.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. You didn\u2019t thank her, or pet her, or admire her, or tell\nher how splendid she\u2019d been.\n\nHIGGINS [impatiently] But she knew all about that. We didn\u2019t make\nspeeches to her, if that\u2019s what you mean.\n\nPICKERING [conscience stricken] Perhaps we were a little inconsiderate.\nIs she very angry?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [returning to her place at the writing-table] Well, I\u2019m\nafraid she won\u2019t go back to Wimpole Street, especially now that Mr.\nDoolittle is able to keep up the position you have thrust on her; but\nshe says she is quite willing to meet you on friendly terms and to let\nbygones be bygones.\n\nHIGGINS [furious] Is she, by George? Ho!\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. If you promise to behave yourself, Henry, I\u2019ll ask her to\ncome down. If not, go home; for you have taken up quite enough of my\ntime.\n\nHIGGINS. Oh, all right. Very well. Pick: you behave yourself. Let us\nput on our best Sunday manners for this creature that we picked out of\nthe mud. [He flings himself sulkily into the Elizabethan chair].\n\nDOOLITTLE [remonstrating] Now, now, Henry Higgins! have some\nconsideration for my feelings as a middle class man.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Remember your promise, Henry. [She presses the\nbell-button on the writing-table]. Mr. Doolittle: will you be so good\nas to step out on the balcony for a moment. I don\u2019t want Eliza to have\nthe shock of your news until she has made it up with these two\ngentlemen. Would you mind?\n\nDOOLITTLE. As you wish, lady. Anything to help Henry to keep her off my\nhands. [He disappears through the window].\n\nThe parlor-maid answers the bell. Pickering sits down in Doolittle\u2019s\nplace.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Ask Miss Doolittle to come down, please.\n\nTHE PARLOR-MAID. Yes, mam. [She goes out].\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Now, Henry: be good.\n\nHIGGINS. I am behaving myself perfectly.\n\nPICKERING. He is doing his best, Mrs. Higgins.\n\nA pause. Higgins throws back his head; stretches out his legs; and\nbegins to whistle.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Henry, dearest, you don\u2019t look at all nice in that\nattitude.\n\nHIGGINS [pulling himself together] I was not trying to look nice,\nmother.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. It doesn\u2019t matter, dear. I only wanted to make you speak.\n\nHIGGINS. Why?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Because you can\u2019t speak and whistle at the same time.\n\nHiggins groans. Another very trying pause.\n\nHIGGINS [springing up, out of patience] Where the devil is that girl?\nAre we to wait here all day?\n\nEliza enters, sunny, self-possessed, and giving a staggeringly\nconvincing exhibition of ease of manner. She carries a little\nwork-basket, and is very much at home. Pickering is too much taken\naback to rise.\n\nLIZA. How do you do, Professor Higgins? Are you quite well?\n\nHIGGINS [choking] Am I\u2014 [He can say no more].\n\nLIZA. But of course you are: you are never ill. So glad to see you\nagain, Colonel Pickering. [He rises hastily; and they shake hands].\nQuite chilly this morning, isn\u2019t it? [She sits down on his left. He\nsits beside her].\n\nHIGGINS. Don\u2019t you dare try this game on me. I taught it to you; and it\ndoesn\u2019t take me in. Get up and come home; and don\u2019t be a fool.\n\nEliza takes a piece of needlework from her basket, and begins to stitch\nat it, without taking the least notice of this outburst.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Very nicely put, indeed, Henry. No woman could resist\nsuch an invitation.\n\nHIGGINS. You let her alone, mother. Let her speak for herself. You will\njolly soon see whether she has an idea that I haven\u2019t put into her head\nor a word that I haven\u2019t put into her mouth. I tell you I have created\nthis thing out of the squashed cabbage leaves of Covent Garden; and now\nshe pretends to play the fine lady with me.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [placidly] Yes, dear; but you\u2019ll sit down, won\u2019t you?\n\nHiggins sits down again, savagely.\n\nLIZA [to Pickering, taking no apparent notice of Higgins, and working\naway deftly] Will you drop me altogether now that the experiment is\nover, Colonel Pickering?\n\nPICKERING. Oh don\u2019t. You mustn\u2019t think of it as an experiment. It\nshocks me, somehow.\n\nLIZA. Oh, I\u2019m only a squashed cabbage leaf.\n\nPICKERING [impulsively] No.\n\nLIZA [continuing quietly]\u2014but I owe so much to you that I should be\nvery unhappy if you forgot me.\n\nPICKERING. It\u2019s very kind of you to say so, Miss Doolittle.\n\nLIZA. It\u2019s not because you paid for my dresses. I know you are generous\nto everybody with money. But it was from you that I learnt really nice\nmanners; and that is what makes one a lady, isn\u2019t it? You see it was so\nvery difficult for me with the example of Professor Higgins always\nbefore me. I was brought up to be just like him, unable to control\nmyself, and using bad language on the slightest provocation. And I\nshould never have known that ladies and gentlemen didn\u2019t behave like\nthat if you hadn\u2019t been there.\n\nHIGGINS. Well!!\n\nPICKERING. Oh, that\u2019s only his way, you know. He doesn\u2019t mean it.\n\nLIZA. Oh, I didn\u2019t mean it either, when I was a flower girl. It was\nonly my way. But you see I did it; and that\u2019s what makes the difference\nafter all.\n\nPICKERING. No doubt. Still, he taught you to speak; and I couldn\u2019t have\ndone that, you know.\n\nLIZA [trivially] Of course: that is his profession.\n\nHIGGINS. Damnation!\n\nLIZA [continuing] It was just like learning to dance in the fashionable\nway: there was nothing more than that in it. But do you know what began\nmy real education?\n\nPICKERING. What?\n\nLIZA [stopping her work for a moment] Your calling me Miss Doolittle\nthat day when I first came to Wimpole Street. That was the beginning of\nself-respect for me. [She resumes her stitching]. And there were a\nhundred little things you never noticed, because they came naturally to\nyou. Things about standing up and taking off your hat and opening\ndoors\u2014\n\nPICKERING. Oh, that was nothing.\n\nLIZA. Yes: things that showed you thought and felt about me as if I\nwere something better than a scullery-maid; though of course I know you\nwould have been just the same to a scullery-maid if she had been let in\nthe drawing-room. You never took off your boots in the dining room when\nI was there.\n\nPICKERING. You mustn\u2019t mind that. Higgins takes off his boots all over\nthe place.\n\nLIZA. I know. I am not blaming him. It is his way, isn\u2019t it? But it\nmade such a difference to me that you didn\u2019t do it. You see, really and\ntruly, apart from the things anyone can pick up (the dressing and the\nproper way of speaking, and so on), the difference between a lady and a\nflower girl is not how she behaves, but how she\u2019s treated. I shall\nalways be a flower girl to Professor Higgins, because he always treats\nme as a flower girl, and always will; but I know I can be a lady to\nyou, because you always treat me as a lady, and always will.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Please don\u2019t grind your teeth, Henry.\n\nPICKERING. Well, this is really very nice of you, Miss Doolittle.\n\nLIZA. I should like you to call me Eliza, now, if you would.\n\nPICKERING. Thank you. Eliza, of course.\n\nLIZA. And I should like Professor Higgins to call me Miss Doolittle.\n\nHIGGINS. I\u2019ll see you damned first.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Henry! Henry!\n\nPICKERING [laughing] Why don\u2019t you slang back at him? Don\u2019t stand it.\nIt would do him a lot of good.\n\nLIZA. I can\u2019t. I could have done it once; but now I can\u2019t go back to\nit. Last night, when I was wandering about, a girl spoke to me; and I\ntried to get back into the old way with her; but it was no use. You\ntold me, you know, that when a child is brought to a foreign country,\nit picks up the language in a few weeks, and forgets its own. Well, I\nam a child in your country. I have forgotten my own language, and can\nspeak nothing but yours. That\u2019s the real break-off with the corner of\nTottenham Court Road. Leaving Wimpole Street finishes it.\n\nPICKERING [much alarmed] Oh! but you\u2019re coming back to Wimpole Street,\naren\u2019t you? You\u2019ll forgive Higgins?\n\nHIGGINS [rising] Forgive! Will she, by George! Let her go. Let her find\nout how she can get on without us. She will relapse into the gutter in\nthree weeks without me at her elbow.\n\nDoolittle appears at the centre window. With a look of dignified\nreproach at Higgins, he comes slowly and silently to his daughter, who,\nwith her back to the window, is unconscious of his approach.\n\nPICKERING. He\u2019s incorrigible, Eliza. You won\u2019t relapse, will you?\n\nLIZA. No: Not now. Never again. I have learnt my lesson. I don\u2019t\nbelieve I could utter one of the old sounds if I tried. [Doolittle\ntouches her on her left shoulder. She drops her work, losing her\nself-possession utterly at the spectacle of her father\u2019s splendor]\nA\u2014a\u2014a\u2014a\u2014a\u2014ah\u2014ow\u2014ooh!\n\nHIGGINS [with a crow of triumph] Aha! Just so. A\u2014a\u2014a\u2014a\u2014ahowooh!\nA\u2014a\u2014a\u2014a\u2014ahowooh ! A\u2014a\u2014a\u2014a\u2014ahowooh! Victory! Victory! [He throws\nhimself on the divan, folding his arms, and spraddling arrogantly].\n\nDOOLITTLE. Can you blame the girl? Don\u2019t look at me like that, Eliza.\nIt ain\u2019t my fault. I\u2019ve come into money.\n\nLIZA. You must have touched a millionaire this time, dad.\n\nDOOLITTLE. I have. But I\u2019m dressed something special today. I\u2019m going\nto St. George\u2019s, Hanover Square. Your stepmother is going to marry me.\n\nLIZA [angrily] You\u2019re going to let yourself down to marry that low\ncommon woman!\n\nPICKERING [quietly] He ought to, Eliza. [To Doolittle] Why has she\nchanged her mind?\n\nDOOLITTLE [sadly] Intimidated, Governor. Intimidated. Middle class\nmorality claims its victim. Won\u2019t you put on your hat, Liza, and come\nand see me turned off?\n\nLIZA. If the Colonel says I must, I\u2014I\u2019ll [almost sobbing] I\u2019ll demean\nmyself. And get insulted for my pains, like enough.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Don\u2019t be afraid: she never comes to words with anyone now,\npoor woman! respectability has broke all the spirit out of her.\n\nPICKERING [squeezing Eliza\u2019s elbow gently] Be kind to them, Eliza. Make\nthe best of it.\n\nLIZA [forcing a little smile for him through her vexation] Oh well,\njust to show there\u2019s no ill feeling. I\u2019ll be back in a moment. [She\ngoes out].\n\nDOOLITTLE [sitting down beside Pickering] I feel uncommon nervous about\nthe ceremony, Colonel. I wish you\u2019d come and see me through it.\n\nPICKERING. But you\u2019ve been through it before, man. You were married to\nEliza\u2019s mother.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Who told you that, Colonel?\n\nPICKERING. Well, nobody told me. But I concluded naturally\u2014\n\nDOOLITTLE. No: that ain\u2019t the natural way, Colonel: it\u2019s only the\nmiddle class way. My way was always the undeserving way. But don\u2019t say\nnothing to Eliza. She don\u2019t know: I always had a delicacy about telling\nher.\n\nPICKERING. Quite right. We\u2019ll leave it so, if you don\u2019t mind.\n\nDOOLITTLE. And you\u2019ll come to the church, Colonel, and put me through\nstraight?\n\nPICKERING. With pleasure. As far as a bachelor can.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. May I come, Mr. Doolittle? I should be very sorry to miss\nyour wedding.\n\nDOOLITTLE. I should indeed be honored by your condescension, ma\u2019am; and\nmy poor old woman would take it as a tremenjous compliment. She\u2019s been\nvery low, thinking of the happy days that are no more.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [rising] I\u2019ll order the carriage and get ready. [The men\nrise, except Higgins]. I shan\u2019t be more than fifteen minutes. [As she\ngoes to the door Eliza comes in, hatted and buttoning her gloves]. I\u2019m\ngoing to the church to see your father married, Eliza. You had better\ncome in the brougham with me. Colonel Pickering can go on with the\nbridegroom.\n\nMrs. Higgins goes out. Eliza comes to the middle of the room between\nthe centre window and the ottoman. Pickering joins her.\n\nDOOLITTLE. Bridegroom! What a word! It makes a man realize his\nposition, somehow. [He takes up his hat and goes towards the door].\n\nPICKERING. Before I go, Eliza, do forgive him and come back to us.\n\nLIZA. I don\u2019t think papa would allow me. Would you, dad?\n\nDOOLITTLE [sad but magnanimous] They played you off very cunning,\nEliza, them two sportsmen. If it had been only one of them, you could\nhave nailed him. But you see, there was two; and one of them chaperoned\nthe other, as you might say. [To Pickering] It was artful of you,\nColonel; but I bear no malice: I should have done the same myself. I\nbeen the victim of one woman after another all my life; and I don\u2019t\ngrudge you two getting the better of Eliza. I shan\u2019t interfere. It\u2019s\ntime for us to go, Colonel. So long, Henry. See you in St. George\u2019s,\nEliza. [He goes out].\n\nPICKERING [coaxing] Do stay with us, Eliza. [He follows Doolittle].\n\nEliza goes out on the balcony to avoid being alone with Higgins. He\nrises and joins her there. She immediately comes back into the room and\nmakes for the door; but he goes along the balcony quickly and gets his\nback to the door before she reaches it.\n\nHIGGINS. Well, Eliza, you\u2019ve had a bit of your own back, as you call\nit. Have you had enough? and are you going to be reasonable? Or do you\nwant any more?\n\nLIZA. You want me back only to pick up your slippers and put up with\nyour tempers and fetch and carry for you.\n\nHIGGINS. I haven\u2019t said I wanted you back at all.\n\nLIZA. Oh, indeed. Then what are we talking about?\n\nHIGGINS. About you, not about me. If you come back I shall treat you\njust as I have always treated you. I can\u2019t change my nature; and I\ndon\u2019t intend to change my manners. My manners are exactly the same as\nColonel Pickering\u2019s.\n\nLIZA. That\u2019s not true. He treats a flower girl as if she was a duchess.\n\nHIGGINS. And I treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl.\n\nLIZA. I see. [She turns away composedly, and sits on the ottoman,\nfacing the window]. The same to everybody.\n\nHIGGINS. Just so.\n\nLIZA. Like father.\n\nHIGGINS [grinning, a little taken down] Without accepting the\ncomparison at all points, Eliza, it\u2019s quite true that your father is\nnot a snob, and that he will be quite at home in any station of life to\nwhich his eccentric destiny may call him. [Seriously] The great secret,\nEliza, is not having bad manners or good manners or any other\nparticular sort of manners, but having the same manner for all human\nsouls: in short, behaving as if you were in Heaven, where there are no\nthird-class carriages, and one soul is as good as another.\n\nLIZA. Amen. You are a born preacher.\n\nHIGGINS [irritated] The question is not whether I treat you rudely, but\nwhether you ever heard me treat anyone else better.\n\nLIZA [with sudden sincerity] I don\u2019t care how you treat me. I don\u2019t\nmind your swearing at me. I don\u2019t mind a black eye: I\u2019ve had one before\nthis. But [standing up and facing him] I won\u2019t be passed over.\n\nHIGGINS. Then get out of my way; for I won\u2019t stop for you. You talk\nabout me as if I were a motor bus.\n\nLIZA. So you are a motor bus: all bounce and go, and no consideration\nfor anyone. But I can do without you: don\u2019t think I can\u2019t.\n\nHIGGINS. I know you can. I told you you could.\n\nLIZA [wounded, getting away from him to the other side of the ottoman\nwith her face to the hearth] I know you did, you brute. You wanted to\nget rid of me.\n\nHIGGINS. Liar.\n\nLIZA. Thank you. [She sits down with dignity].\n\nHIGGINS. You never asked yourself, I suppose, whether I could do\nwithout YOU.\n\nLIZA [earnestly] Don\u2019t you try to get round me. You\u2019ll HAVE to do\nwithout me.\n\nHIGGINS [arrogant] I can do without anybody. I have my own soul: my own\nspark of divine fire. But [with sudden humility] I shall miss you,\nEliza. [He sits down near her on the ottoman]. I have learnt something\nfrom your idiotic notions: I confess that humbly and gratefully. And I\nhave grown accustomed to your voice and appearance. I like them, rather.\n\nLIZA. Well, you have both of them on your gramophone and in your book\nof photographs. When you feel lonely without me, you can turn the\nmachine on. It\u2019s got no feelings to hurt.\n\nHIGGINS. I can\u2019t turn your soul on. Leave me those feelings; and you\ncan take away the voice and the face. They are not you.\n\nLIZA. Oh, you ARE a devil. You can twist the heart in a girl as easy as\nsome could twist her arms to hurt her. Mrs. Pearce warned me. Time and\nagain she has wanted to leave you; and you always got round her at the\nlast minute. And you don\u2019t care a bit for her. And you don\u2019t care a bit\nfor me.\n\nHIGGINS. I care for life, for humanity; and you are a part of it that\nhas come my way and been built into my house. What more can you or\nanyone ask?\n\nLIZA. I won\u2019t care for anybody that doesn\u2019t care for me.\n\nHIGGINS. Commercial principles, Eliza. Like [reproducing her Covent\nGarden pronunciation with professional exactness] s\u2019yollin voylets\n[selling violets], isn\u2019t it?\n\nLIZA. Don\u2019t sneer at me. It\u2019s mean to sneer at me.\n\nHIGGINS. I have never sneered in my life. Sneering doesn\u2019t become\neither the human face or the human soul. I am expressing my righteous\ncontempt for Commercialism. I don\u2019t and won\u2019t trade in affection. You\ncall me a brute because you couldn\u2019t buy a claim on me by fetching my\nslippers and finding my spectacles. You were a fool: I think a woman\nfetching a man\u2019s slippers is a disgusting sight: did I ever fetch YOUR\nslippers? I think a good deal more of you for throwing them in my face.\nNo use slaving for me and then saying you want to be cared for: who\ncares for a slave? If you come back, come back for the sake of good\nfellowship; for you\u2019ll get nothing else. You\u2019ve had a thousand times as\nmuch out of me as I have out of you; and if you dare to set up your\nlittle dog\u2019s tricks of fetching and carrying slippers against my\ncreation of a Duchess Eliza, I\u2019ll slam the door in your silly face.\n\nLIZA. What did you do it for if you didn\u2019t care for me?\n\nHIGGINS [heartily] Why, because it was my job.\n\nLIZA. You never thought of the trouble it would make for me.\n\nHIGGINS. Would the world ever have been made if its maker had been\nafraid of making trouble? Making life means making trouble. There\u2019s\nonly one way of escaping trouble; and that\u2019s killing things. Cowards,\nyou notice, are always shrieking to have troublesome people killed.\n\nLIZA. I\u2019m no preacher: I don\u2019t notice things like that. I notice that\nyou don\u2019t notice me.\n\nHIGGINS [jumping up and walking about intolerantly] Eliza: you\u2019re an\nidiot. I waste the treasures of my Miltonic mind by spreading them\nbefore you. Once for all, understand that I go my way and do my work\nwithout caring twopence what happens to either of us. I am not\nintimidated, like your father and your stepmother. So you can come back\nor go to the devil: which you please.\n\nLIZA. What am I to come back for?\n\nHIGGINS [bouncing up on his knees on the ottoman and leaning over it to\nher] For the fun of it. That\u2019s why I took you on.\n\nLIZA [with averted face] And you may throw me out tomorrow if I don\u2019t\ndo everything you want me to?\n\nHIGGINS. Yes; and you may walk out tomorrow if I don\u2019t do everything\nYOU want me to.\n\nLIZA. And live with my stepmother?\n\nHIGGINS. Yes, or sell flowers.\n\nLIZA. Oh! if I only COULD go back to my flower basket! I should be\nindependent of both you and father and all the world! Why did you take\nmy independence from me? Why did I give it up? I\u2019m a slave now, for all\nmy fine clothes.\n\nHIGGINS. Not a bit. I\u2019ll adopt you as my daughter and settle money on\nyou if you like. Or would you rather marry Pickering?\n\nLIZA [looking fiercely round at him] I wouldn\u2019t marry YOU if you asked\nme; and you\u2019re nearer my age than what he is.\n\nHIGGINS [gently] Than he is: not \u201cthan what he is.\u201d\n\nLIZA [losing her temper and rising] I\u2019ll talk as I like. You\u2019re not my\nteacher now.\n\nHIGGINS [reflectively] I don\u2019t suppose Pickering would, though. He\u2019s as\nconfirmed an old bachelor as I am.\n\nLIZA. That\u2019s not what I want; and don\u2019t you think it. I\u2019ve always had\nchaps enough wanting me that way. Freddy Hill writes to me twice and\nthree times a day, sheets and sheets.\n\nHIGGINS [disagreeably surprised] Damn his impudence! [He recoils and\nfinds himself sitting on his heels].\n\nLIZA. He has a right to if he likes, poor lad. And he does love me.\n\nHIGGINS [getting off the ottoman] You have no right to encourage him.\n\nLIZA. Every girl has a right to be loved.\n\nHIGGINS. What! By fools like that?\n\nLIZA. Freddy\u2019s not a fool. And if he\u2019s weak and poor and wants me, may\nbe he\u2019d make me happier than my betters that bully me and don\u2019t want me.\n\nHIGGINS. Can he MAKE anything of you? That\u2019s the point.\n\nLIZA. Perhaps I could make something of him. But I never thought of us\nmaking anything of one another; and you never think of anything else. I\nonly want to be natural.\n\nHIGGINS. In short, you want me to be as infatuated about you as Freddy?\nIs that it?\n\nLIZA. No I don\u2019t. That\u2019s not the sort of feeling I want from you. And\ndon\u2019t you be too sure of yourself or of me. I could have been a bad\ngirl if I\u2019d liked. I\u2019ve seen more of some things than you, for all your\nlearning. Girls like me can drag gentlemen down to make love to them\neasy enough. And they wish each other dead the next minute.\n\nHIGGINS. Of course they do. Then what in thunder are we quarrelling\nabout?\n\nLIZA [much troubled] I want a little kindness. I know I\u2019m a common\nignorant girl, and you a book-learned gentleman; but I\u2019m not dirt under\nyour feet. What I done [correcting herself] what I did was not for the\ndresses and the taxis: I did it because we were pleasant together and I\ncome\u2014came\u2014to care for you; not to want you to make love to me, and\nnot forgetting the difference between us, but more friendly like.\n\nHIGGINS. Well, of course. That\u2019s just how I feel. And how Pickering\nfeels. Eliza: you\u2019re a fool.\n\nLIZA. That\u2019s not a proper answer to give me [she sinks on the chair at\nthe writing-table in tears].\n\nHIGGINS. It\u2019s all you\u2019ll get until you stop being a common idiot. If\nyou\u2019re going to be a lady, you\u2019ll have to give up feeling neglected if\nthe men you know don\u2019t spend half their time snivelling over you and\nthe other half giving you black eyes. If you can\u2019t stand the coldness\nof my sort of life, and the strain of it, go back to the gutter. Work\ntil you are more a brute than a human being; and then cuddle and\nsquabble and drink til you fall asleep. Oh, it\u2019s a fine life, the life\nof the gutter. It\u2019s real: it\u2019s warm: it\u2019s violent: you can feel it\nthrough the thickest skin: you can taste it and smell it without any\ntraining or any work. Not like Science and Literature and Classical\nMusic and Philosophy and Art. You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,\ndon\u2019t you? Very well: be off with you to the sort of people you like.\nMarry some sentimental hog or other with lots of money, and a thick\npair of lips to kiss you with and a thick pair of boots to kick you\nwith. If you can\u2019t appreciate what you\u2019ve got, you\u2019d better get what\nyou can appreciate.\n\nLIZA [desperate] Oh, you are a cruel tyrant. I can\u2019t talk to you: you\nturn everything against me: I\u2019m always in the wrong. But you know very\nwell all the time that you\u2019re nothing but a bully. You know I can\u2019t go\nback to the gutter, as you call it, and that I have no real friends in\nthe world but you and the Colonel. You know well I couldn\u2019t bear to\nlive with a low common man after you two; and it\u2019s wicked and cruel of\nyou to insult me by pretending I could. You think I must go back to\nWimpole Street because I have nowhere else to go but father\u2019s. But\ndon\u2019t you be too sure that you have me under your feet to be trampled\non and talked down. I\u2019ll marry Freddy, I will, as soon as he\u2019s able to\nsupport me.\n\nHIGGINS [sitting down beside her] Rubbish! you shall marry an\nambassador. You shall marry the Governor-General of India or the\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland, or somebody who wants a deputy-queen. I\u2019m\nnot going to have my masterpiece thrown away on Freddy.\n\nLIZA. You think I like you to say that. But I haven\u2019t forgot what you\nsaid a minute ago; and I won\u2019t be coaxed round as if I was a baby or a\npuppy. If I can\u2019t have kindness, I\u2019ll have independence.\n\nHIGGINS. Independence? That\u2019s middle class blasphemy. We are all\ndependent on one another, every soul of us on earth.\n\nLIZA [rising determinedly] I\u2019ll let you see whether I\u2019m dependent on\nyou. If you can preach, I can teach. I\u2019ll go and be a teacher.\n\nHIGGINS. What\u2019ll you teach, in heaven\u2019s name?\n\nLIZA. What you taught me. I\u2019ll teach phonetics.\n\nHIGGINS. Ha! Ha! Ha!\n\nLIZA. I\u2019ll offer myself as an assistant to Professor Nepean.\n\nHIGGINS [rising in a fury] What! That impostor! that humbug! that\ntoadying ignoramus! Teach him my methods! my discoveries! You take one\nstep in his direction and I\u2019ll wring your neck. [He lays hands on her].\nDo you hear?\n\nLIZA [defiantly non-resistant] Wring away. What do I care? I knew you\u2019d\nstrike me some day. [He lets her go, stamping with rage at having\nforgotten himself, and recoils so hastily that he stumbles back into\nhis seat on the ottoman]. Aha! Now I know how to deal with you. What a\nfool I was not to think of it before! You can\u2019t take away the knowledge\nyou gave me. You said I had a finer ear than you. And I can be civil\nand kind to people, which is more than you can. Aha! That\u2019s done you,\nHenry Higgins, it has. Now I don\u2019t care that [snapping her fingers] for\nyour bullying and your big talk. I\u2019ll advertize it in the papers that\nyour duchess is only a flower girl that you taught, and that she\u2019ll\nteach anybody to be a duchess just the same in six months for a\nthousand guineas. Oh, when I think of myself crawling under your feet\nand being trampled on and called names, when all the time I had only to\nlift up my finger to be as good as you, I could just kick myself.\n\nHIGGINS [wondering at her] You damned impudent slut, you! But it\u2019s\nbetter than snivelling; better than fetching slippers and finding\nspectacles, isn\u2019t it? [Rising] By George, Eliza, I said I\u2019d make a\nwoman of you; and I have. I like you like this.\n\nLIZA. Yes: you turn round and make up to me now that I\u2019m not afraid of\nyou, and can do without you.\n\nHIGGINS. Of course I do, you little fool. Five minutes ago you were\nlike a millstone round my neck. Now you\u2019re a tower of strength: a\nconsort battleship. You and I and Pickering will be three old bachelors\ntogether instead of only two men and a silly girl.\n\nMrs. Higgins returns, dressed for the wedding. Eliza instantly becomes\ncool and elegant.\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. The carriage is waiting, Eliza. Are you ready?\n\nLIZA. Quite. Is the Professor coming?\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. Certainly not. He can\u2019t behave himself in church. He\nmakes remarks out loud all the time on the clergyman\u2019s pronunciation.\n\nLIZA. Then I shall not see you again, Professor. Good bye. [She goes to\nthe door].\n\nMRS. HIGGINS [coming to Higgins] Good-bye, dear.\n\nHIGGINS. Good-bye, mother. [He is about to kiss her, when he recollects\nsomething]. Oh, by the way, Eliza, order a ham and a Stilton cheese,\nwill you? And buy me a pair of reindeer gloves, number eights, and a\ntie to match that new suit of mine, at Eale & Binman\u2019s. You can choose\nthe color. [His cheerful, careless, vigorous voice shows that he is\nincorrigible].\n\nLIZA [disdainfully] Buy them yourself. [She sweeps out].\n\nMRS. HIGGINS. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve spoiled that girl, Henry. But never\nmind, dear: I\u2019ll buy you the tie and gloves.\n\nHIGGINS [sunnily] Oh, don\u2019t bother. She\u2019ll buy em all right enough.\nGood-bye.\n\nThey kiss. Mrs. Higgins runs out. Higgins, left alone, rattles his cash\nin his pocket; chuckles; and disports himself in a highly\nself-satisfied manner.\n\n                    ***********************\n\nThe rest of the story need not be shown in action, and indeed, would\nhardly need telling if our imaginations were not so enfeebled by their\nlazy dependence on the ready-makes and reach-me-downs of the ragshop in\nwhich Romance keeps its stock of \u201chappy endings\u201d to misfit all stories.\nNow, the history of Eliza Doolittle, though called a romance because of\nthe transfiguration it records seems exceedingly improbable, is common\nenough. Such transfigurations have been achieved by hundreds of\nresolutely ambitious young women since Nell Gwynne set them the example\nby playing queens and fascinating kings in the theatre in which she\nbegan by selling oranges. Nevertheless, people in all directions have\nassumed, for no other reason than that she became the heroine of a\nromance, that she must have married the hero of it. This is unbearable,\nnot only because her little drama, if acted on such a thoughtless\nassumption, must be spoiled, but because the true sequel is patent to\nanyone with a sense of human nature in general, and of feminine\ninstinct in particular.\n\nEliza, in telling Higgins she would not marry him if he asked her, was\nnot coquetting: she was announcing a well-considered decision. When a\nbachelor interests, and dominates, and teaches, and becomes important\nto a spinster, as Higgins with Eliza, she always, if she has character\nenough to be capable of it, considers very seriously indeed whether she\nwill play for becoming that bachelor\u2019s wife, especially if he is so\nlittle interested in marriage that a determined and devoted woman might\ncapture him if she set herself resolutely to do it. Her decision will\ndepend a good deal on whether she is really free to choose; and that,\nagain, will depend on her age and income. If she is at the end of her\nyouth, and has no security for her livelihood, she will marry him\nbecause she must marry anybody who will provide for her. But at Eliza\u2019s\nage a good-looking girl does not feel that pressure; she feels free to\npick and choose. She is therefore guided by her instinct in the matter.\nEliza\u2019s instinct tells her not to marry Higgins. It does not tell her\nto give him up. It is not in the slightest doubt as to his remaining\none of the strongest personal interests in her life. It would be very\nsorely strained if there was another woman likely to supplant her with\nhim. But as she feels sure of him on that last point, she has no doubt\nat all as to her course, and would not have any, even if the difference\nof twenty years in age, which seems so great to youth, did not exist\nbetween them.\n\nAs our own instincts are not appealed to by her conclusion, let us see\nwhether we cannot discover some reason in it. When Higgins excused his\nindifference to young women on the ground that they had an irresistible\nrival in his mother, he gave the clue to his inveterate\nold-bachelordom. The case is uncommon only to the extent that\nremarkable mothers are uncommon. If an imaginative boy has a\nsufficiently rich mother who has intelligence, personal grace, dignity\nof character without harshness, and a cultivated sense of the best art\nof her time to enable her to make her house beautiful, she sets a\nstandard for him against which very few women can struggle, besides\neffecting for him a disengagement of his affections, his sense of\nbeauty, and his idealism from his specifically sexual impulses. This\nmakes him a standing puzzle to the huge number of uncultivated people\nwho have been brought up in tasteless homes by commonplace or\ndisagreeable parents, and to whom, consequently, literature, painting,\nsculpture, music, and affectionate personal relations come as modes of\nsex if they come at all. The word passion means nothing else to them;\nand that Higgins could have a passion for phonetics and idealize his\nmother instead of Eliza, would seem to them absurd and unnatural.\nNevertheless, when we look round and see that hardly anyone is too ugly\nor disagreeable to find a wife or a husband if he or she wants one,\nwhilst many old maids and bachelors are above the average in quality\nand culture, we cannot help suspecting that the disentanglement of sex\nfrom the associations with which it is so commonly confused, a\ndisentanglement which persons of genius achieve by sheer intellectual\nanalysis, is sometimes produced or aided by parental fascination.\n\nNow, though Eliza was incapable of thus explaining to herself Higgins\u2019s\nformidable powers of resistance to the charm that prostrated Freddy at\nthe first glance, she was instinctively aware that she could never\nobtain a complete grip of him, or come between him and his mother (the\nfirst necessity of the married woman). To put it shortly, she knew that\nfor some mysterious reason he had not the makings of a married man in\nhim, according to her conception of a husband as one to whom she would\nbe his nearest and fondest and warmest interest. Even had there been no\nmother-rival, she would still have refused to accept an interest in\nherself that was secondary to philosophic interests. Had Mrs. Higgins\ndied, there would still have been Milton and the Universal Alphabet.\nLandor\u2019s remark that to those who have the greatest power of loving,\nlove is a secondary affair, would not have recommended Landor to Eliza.\nPut that along with her resentment of Higgins\u2019s domineering\nsuperiority, and her mistrust of his coaxing cleverness in getting\nround her and evading her wrath when he had gone too far with his\nimpetuous bullying, and you will see that Eliza\u2019s instinct had good\ngrounds for warning her not to marry her Pygmalion.\n\nAnd now, whom did Eliza marry? For if Higgins was a predestinate old\nbachelor, she was most certainly not a predestinate old maid. Well,\nthat can be told very shortly to those who have not guessed it from the\nindications she has herself given them.\n\nAlmost immediately after Eliza is stung into proclaiming her considered\ndetermination not to marry Higgins, she mentions the fact that young\nMr. Frederick Eynsford Hill is pouring out his love for her daily\nthrough the post. Now Freddy is young, practically twenty years younger\nthan Higgins: he is a gentleman (or, as Eliza would qualify him, a\ntoff), and speaks like one; he is nicely dressed, is treated by the\nColonel as an equal, loves her unaffectedly, and is not her master, nor\never likely to dominate her in spite of his advantage of social\nstanding. Eliza has no use for the foolish romantic tradition that all\nwomen love to be mastered, if not actually bullied and beaten. \u201cWhen\nyou go to women,\u201d says Nietzsche, \u201ctake your whip with you.\u201d Sensible\ndespots have never confined that precaution to women: they have taken\ntheir whips with them when they have dealt with men, and been slavishly\nidealized by the men over whom they have flourished the whip much more\nthan by women. No doubt there are slavish women as well as slavish men;\nand women, like men, admire those that are stronger than themselves.\nBut to admire a strong person and to live under that strong person\u2019s\nthumb are two different things. The weak may not be admired and\nhero-worshipped; but they are by no means disliked or shunned; and they\nnever seem to have the least difficulty in marrying people who are too\ngood for them. They may fail in emergencies; but life is not one long\nemergency: it is mostly a string of situations for which no exceptional\nstrength is needed, and with which even rather weak people can cope if\nthey have a stronger partner to help them out. Accordingly, it is a\ntruth everywhere in evidence that strong people, masculine or feminine,\nnot only do not marry stronger people, but do not show any preference\nfor them in selecting their friends. When a lion meets another with a\nlouder roar \u201cthe first lion thinks the last a bore.\u201d The man or woman\nwho feels strong enough for two, seeks for every other quality in a\npartner than strength.\n\nThe converse is also true. Weak people want to marry strong people who\ndo not frighten them too much; and this often leads them to make the\nmistake we describe metaphorically as \u201cbiting off more than they can\nchew.\u201d They want too much for too little; and when the bargain is\nunreasonable beyond all bearing, the union becomes impossible: it ends\nin the weaker party being either discarded or borne as a cross, which\nis worse. People who are not only weak, but silly or obtuse as well,\nare often in these difficulties.\n\nThis being the state of human affairs, what is Eliza fairly sure to do\nwhen she is placed between Freddy and Higgins? Will she look forward to\na lifetime of fetching Higgins\u2019s slippers or to a lifetime of Freddy\nfetching hers? There can be no doubt about the answer. Unless Freddy is\nbiologically repulsive to her, and Higgins biologically attractive to a\ndegree that overwhelms all her other instincts, she will, if she\nmarries either of them, marry Freddy.\n\nAnd that is just what Eliza did.\n\nComplications ensued; but they were economic, not romantic. Freddy had\nno money and no occupation. His mother\u2019s jointure, a last relic of the\nopulence of Largelady Park, had enabled her to struggle along in\nEarlscourt with an air of gentility, but not to procure any serious\nsecondary education for her children, much less give the boy a\nprofession. A clerkship at thirty shillings a week was beneath Freddy\u2019s\ndignity, and extremely distasteful to him besides. His prospects\nconsisted of a hope that if he kept up appearances somebody would do\nsomething for him. The something appeared vaguely to his imagination as\na private secretaryship or a sinecure of some sort. To his mother it\nperhaps appeared as a marriage to some lady of means who could not\nresist her boy\u2019s niceness. Fancy her feelings when he married a flower\ngirl who had become declassee under extraordinary circumstances which\nwere now notorious!\n\nIt is true that Eliza\u2019s situation did not seem wholly ineligible. Her\nfather, though formerly a dustman, and now fantastically disclassed,\nhad become extremely popular in the smartest society by a social talent\nwhich triumphed over every prejudice and every disadvantage. Rejected\nby the middle class, which he loathed, he had shot up at once into the\nhighest circles by his wit, his dustmanship (which he carried like a\nbanner), and his Nietzschean transcendence of good and evil. At\nintimate ducal dinners he sat on the right hand of the Duchess; and in\ncountry houses he smoked in the pantry and was made much of by the\nbutler when he was not feeding in the dining-room and being consulted\nby cabinet ministers. But he found it almost as hard to do all this on\nfour thousand a year as Mrs. Eynsford Hill to live in Earlscourt on an\nincome so pitiably smaller that I have not the heart to disclose its\nexact figure. He absolutely refused to add the last straw to his burden\nby contributing to Eliza\u2019s support.\n\nThus Freddy and Eliza, now Mr. and Mrs. Eynsford Hill, would have spent\na penniless honeymoon but for a wedding present of 500 pounds from the\nColonel to Eliza. It lasted a long time because Freddy did not know how\nto spend money, never having had any to spend, and Eliza, socially\ntrained by a pair of old bachelors, wore her clothes as long as they\nheld together and looked pretty, without the least regard to their\nbeing many months out of fashion. Still, 500 pounds will not last two\nyoung people for ever; and they both knew, and Eliza felt as well, that\nthey must shift for themselves in the end. She could quarter herself on\nWimpole Street because it had come to be her home; but she was quite\naware that she ought not to quarter Freddy there, and that it would not\nbe good for his character if she did.\n\nNot that the Wimpole Street bachelors objected. When she consulted\nthem, Higgins declined to be bothered about her housing problem when\nthat solution was so simple. Eliza\u2019s desire to have Freddy in the house\nwith her seemed of no more importance than if she had wanted an extra\npiece of bedroom furniture. Pleas as to Freddy\u2019s character, and the\nmoral obligation on him to earn his own living, were lost on Higgins.\nHe denied that Freddy had any character, and declared that if he tried\nto do any useful work some competent person would have the trouble of\nundoing it: a procedure involving a net loss to the community, and\ngreat unhappiness to Freddy himself, who was obviously intended by\nNature for such light work as amusing Eliza, which, Higgins declared,\nwas a much more useful and honorable occupation than working in the\ncity. When Eliza referred again to her project of teaching phonetics,\nHiggins abated not a jot of his violent opposition to it. He said she\nwas not within ten years of being qualified to meddle with his pet\nsubject; and as it was evident that the Colonel agreed with him, she\nfelt she could not go against them in this grave matter, and that she\nhad no right, without Higgins\u2019s consent, to exploit the knowledge he\nhad given her; for his knowledge seemed to her as much his private\nproperty as his watch: Eliza was no communist. Besides, she was\nsuperstitiously devoted to them both, more entirely and frankly after\nher marriage than before it.\n\nIt was the Colonel who finally solved the problem, which had cost him\nmuch perplexed cogitation. He one day asked Eliza, rather shyly,\nwhether she had quite given up her notion of keeping a flower shop. She\nreplied that she had thought of it, but had put it out of her head,\nbecause the Colonel had said, that day at Mrs. Higgins\u2019s, that it would\nnever do. The Colonel confessed that when he said that, he had not\nquite recovered from the dazzling impression of the day before. They\nbroke the matter to Higgins that evening. The sole comment vouchsafed\nby him very nearly led to a serious quarrel with Eliza. It was to the\neffect that she would have in Freddy an ideal errand boy.\n\nFreddy himself was next sounded on the subject. He said he had been\nthinking of a shop himself; though it had presented itself to his\npennilessness as a small place in which Eliza should sell tobacco at\none counter whilst he sold newspapers at the opposite one. But he\nagreed that it would be extraordinarily jolly to go early every morning\nwith Eliza to Covent Garden and buy flowers on the scene of their first\nmeeting: a sentiment which earned him many kisses from his wife. He\nadded that he had always been afraid to propose anything of the sort,\nbecause Clara would make an awful row about a step that must damage her\nmatrimonial chances, and his mother could not be expected to like it\nafter clinging for so many years to that step of the social ladder on\nwhich retail trade is impossible.\n\nThis difficulty was removed by an event highly unexpected by Freddy\u2019s\nmother. Clara, in the course of her incursions into those artistic\ncircles which were the highest within her reach, discovered that her\nconversational qualifications were expected to include a grounding in\nthe novels of Mr. H.G. Wells. She borrowed them in various directions\nso energetically that she swallowed them all within two months. The\nresult was a conversion of a kind quite common today. A modern Acts of\nthe Apostles would fill fifty whole Bibles if anyone were capable of\nwriting it.\n\nPoor Clara, who appeared to Higgins and his mother as a disagreeable\nand ridiculous person, and to her own mother as in some inexplicable\nway a social failure, had never seen herself in either light; for,\nthough to some extent ridiculed and mimicked in West Kensington like\neverybody else there, she was accepted as a rational and normal\u2014or\nshall we say inevitable?\u2014sort of human being. At worst they called her\nThe Pusher; but to them no more than to herself had it ever occurred\nthat she was pushing the air, and pushing it in a wrong direction.\nStill, she was not happy. She was growing desperate. Her one asset, the\nfact that her mother was what the Epsom greengrocer called a carriage\nlady had no exchange value, apparently. It had prevented her from\ngetting educated, because the only education she could have afforded\nwas education with the Earlscourt green grocer\u2019s daughter. It had led\nher to seek the society of her mother\u2019s class; and that class simply\nwould not have her, because she was much poorer than the greengrocer,\nand, far from being able to afford a maid, could not afford even a\nhousemaid, and had to scrape along at home with an illiberally treated\ngeneral servant. Under such circumstances nothing could give her an air\nof being a genuine product of Largelady Park. And yet its tradition\nmade her regard a marriage with anyone within her reach as an\nunbearable humiliation. Commercial people and professional people in a\nsmall way were odious to her. She ran after painters and novelists; but\nshe did not charm them; and her bold attempts to pick up and practise\nartistic and literary talk irritated them. She was, in short, an utter\nfailure, an ignorant, incompetent, pretentious, unwelcome, penniless,\nuseless little snob; and though she did not admit these\ndisqualifications (for nobody ever faces unpleasant truths of this kind\nuntil the possibility of a way out dawns on them) she felt their\neffects too keenly to be satisfied with her position.\n\nClara had a startling eyeopener when, on being suddenly wakened to\nenthusiasm by a girl of her own age who dazzled her and produced in her\na gushing desire to take her for a model, and gain her friendship, she\ndiscovered that this exquisite apparition had graduated from the gutter\nin a few months\u2019 time. It shook her so violently, that when Mr. H. G.\nWells lifted her on the point of his puissant pen, and placed her at\nthe angle of view from which the life she was leading and the society\nto which she clung appeared in its true relation to real human needs\nand worthy social structure, he effected a conversion and a conviction\nof sin comparable to the most sensational feats of General Booth or\nGypsy Smith. Clara\u2019s snobbery went bang. Life suddenly began to move\nwith her. Without knowing how or why, she began to make friends and\nenemies. Some of the acquaintances to whom she had been a tedious or\nindifferent or ridiculous affliction, dropped her: others became\ncordial. To her amazement she found that some \u201cquite nice\u201d people were\nsaturated with Wells, and that this accessibility to ideas was the\nsecret of their niceness. People she had thought deeply religious, and\nhad tried to conciliate on that tack with disastrous results, suddenly\ntook an interest in her, and revealed a hostility to conventional\nreligion which she had never conceived possible except among the most\ndesperate characters. They made her read Galsworthy; and Galsworthy\nexposed the vanity of Largelady Park and finished her. It exasperated\nher to think that the dungeon in which she had languished for so many\nunhappy years had been unlocked all the time, and that the impulses she\nhad so carefully struggled with and stifled for the sake of keeping\nwell with society, were precisely those by which alone she could have\ncome into any sort of sincere human contact. In the radiance of these\ndiscoveries, and the tumult of their reaction, she made a fool of\nherself as freely and conspicuously as when she so rashly adopted\nEliza\u2019s expletive in Mrs. Higgins\u2019s drawing-room; for the new-born\nWellsian had to find her bearings almost as ridiculously as a baby; but\nnobody hates a baby for its ineptitudes, or thinks the worse of it for\ntrying to eat the matches; and Clara lost no friends by her follies.\nThey laughed at her to her face this time; and she had to defend\nherself and fight it out as best she could.\n\nWhen Freddy paid a visit to Earlscourt (which he never did when he\ncould possibly help it) to make the desolating announcement that he and\nhis Eliza were thinking of blackening the Largelady scutcheon by\nopening a shop, he found the little household already convulsed by a\nprior announcement from Clara that she also was going to work in an old\nfurniture shop in Dover Street, which had been started by a fellow\nWellsian. This appointment Clara owed, after all, to her old social\naccomplishment of Push. She had made up her mind that, cost what it\nmight, she would see Mr. Wells in the flesh; and she had achieved her\nend at a garden party. She had better luck than so rash an enterprise\ndeserved. Mr. Wells came up to her expectations. Age had not withered\nhim, nor could custom stale his infinite variety in half an hour. His\npleasant neatness and compactness, his small hands and feet, his\nteeming ready brain, his unaffected accessibility, and a certain fine\napprehensiveness which stamped him as susceptible from his topmost hair\nto his tipmost toe, proved irresistible. Clara talked of nothing else\nfor weeks and weeks afterwards. And as she happened to talk to the lady\nof the furniture shop, and that lady also desired above all things to\nknow Mr. Wells and sell pretty things to him, she offered Clara a job\non the chance of achieving that end through her.\n\nAnd so it came about that Eliza\u2019s luck held, and the expected\nopposition to the flower shop melted away. The shop is in the arcade of\na railway station not very far from the Victoria and Albert Museum; and\nif you live in that neighborhood you may go there any day and buy a\nbuttonhole from Eliza.\n\nNow here is a last opportunity for romance. Would you not like to be\nassured that the shop was an immense success, thanks to Eliza\u2019s charms\nand her early business experience in Covent Garden? Alas! the truth is\nthe truth: the shop did not pay for a long time, simply because Eliza\nand her Freddy did not know how to keep it. True, Eliza had not to\nbegin at the very beginning: she knew the names and prices of the\ncheaper flowers; and her elation was unbounded when she found that\nFreddy, like all youths educated at cheap, pretentious, and thoroughly\ninefficient schools, knew a little Latin. It was very little, but\nenough to make him appear to her a Porson or Bentley, and to put him at\nhis ease with botanical nomenclature. Unfortunately he knew nothing\nelse; and Eliza, though she could count money up to eighteen shillings\nor so, and had acquired a certain familiarity with the language of\nMilton from her struggles to qualify herself for winning Higgins\u2019s bet,\ncould not write out a bill without utterly disgracing the\nestablishment. Freddy\u2019s power of stating in Latin that Balbus built a\nwall and that Gaul was divided into three parts did not carry with it\nthe slightest knowledge of accounts or business: Colonel Pickering had\nto explain to him what a cheque book and a bank account meant. And the\npair were by no means easily teachable. Freddy backed up Eliza in her\nobstinate refusal to believe that they could save money by engaging a\nbookkeeper with some knowledge of the business. How, they argued, could\nyou possibly save money by going to extra expense when you already\ncould not make both ends meet? But the Colonel, after making the ends\nmeet over and over again, at last gently insisted; and Eliza, humbled\nto the dust by having to beg from him so often, and stung by the\nuproarious derision of Higgins, to whom the notion of Freddy succeeding\nat anything was a joke that never palled, grasped the fact that\nbusiness, like phonetics, has to be learned.\n\nOn the piteous spectacle of the pair spending their evenings in\nshorthand schools and polytechnic classes, learning bookkeeping and\ntypewriting with incipient junior clerks, male and female, from the\nelementary schools, let me not dwell. There were even classes at the\nLondon School of Economics, and a humble personal appeal to the\ndirector of that institution to recommend a course bearing on the\nflower business. He, being a humorist, explained to them the method of\nthe celebrated Dickensian essay on Chinese Metaphysics by the gentleman\nwho read an article on China and an article on Metaphysics and combined\nthe information. He suggested that they should combine the London\nSchool with Kew Gardens. Eliza, to whom the procedure of the Dickensian\ngentleman seemed perfectly correct (as in fact it was) and not in the\nleast funny (which was only her ignorance) took his advice with entire\ngravity. But the effort that cost her the deepest humiliation was a\nrequest to Higgins, whose pet artistic fancy, next to Milton\u2019s verse,\nwas calligraphy, and who himself wrote a most beautiful Italian hand,\nthat he would teach her to write. He declared that she was congenitally\nincapable of forming a single letter worthy of the least of Milton\u2019s\nwords; but she persisted; and again he suddenly threw himself into the\ntask of teaching her with a combination of stormy intensity,\nconcentrated patience, and occasional bursts of interesting\ndisquisition on the beauty and nobility, the august mission and\ndestiny, of human handwriting. Eliza ended by acquiring an extremely\nuncommercial script which was a positive extension of her personal\nbeauty, and spending three times as much on stationery as anyone else\nbecause certain qualities and shapes of paper became indispensable to\nher. She could not even address an envelope in the usual way because it\nmade the margins all wrong.\n\nTheir commercial school days were a period of disgrace and despair for\nthe young couple. They seemed to be learning nothing about flower\nshops. At last they gave it up as hopeless, and shook the dust of the\nshorthand schools, and the polytechnics, and the London School of\nEconomics from their feet for ever. Besides, the business was in some\nmysterious way beginning to take care of itself. They had somehow\nforgotten their objections to employing other people. They came to the\nconclusion that their own way was the best, and that they had really a\nremarkable talent for business. The Colonel, who had been compelled for\nsome years to keep a sufficient sum on current account at his bankers\nto make up their deficits, found that the provision was unnecessary:\nthe young people were prospering. It is true that there was not quite\nfair play between them and their competitors in trade. Their week-ends\nin the country cost them nothing, and saved them the price of their\nSunday dinners; for the motor car was the Colonel\u2019s; and he and Higgins\npaid the hotel bills. Mr. F. Hill, florist and greengrocer (they soon\ndiscovered that there was money in asparagus; and asparagus led to\nother vegetables), had an air which stamped the business as classy; and\nin private life he was still Frederick Eynsford Hill, Esquire. Not that\nthere was any swank about him: nobody but Eliza knew that he had been\nchristened Frederick Challoner. Eliza herself swanked like anything.\n\nThat is all. That is how it has turned out. It is astonishing how much\nEliza still manages to meddle in the housekeeping at Wimpole Street in\nspite of the shop and her own family. And it is notable that though she\nnever nags her husband, and frankly loves the Colonel as if she were\nhis favorite daughter, she has never got out of the habit of nagging\nHiggins that was established on the fatal night when she won his bet\nfor him. She snaps his head off on the faintest provocation, or on\nnone. He no longer dares to tease her by assuming an abysmal\ninferiority of Freddy\u2019s mind to his own. He storms and bullies and\nderides; but she stands up to him so ruthlessly that the Colonel has to\nask her from time to time to be kinder to Higgins; and it is the only\nrequest of his that brings a mulish expression into her face. Nothing\nbut some emergency or calamity great enough to break down all likes and\ndislikes, and throw them both back on their common humanity\u2014and may\nthey be spared any such trial!\u2014will ever alter this. She knows that\nHiggins does not need her, just as her father did not need her. The\nvery scrupulousness with which he told her that day that he had become\nused to having her there, and dependent on her for all sorts of little\nservices, and that he should miss her if she went away (it would never\nhave occurred to Freddy or the Colonel to say anything of the sort)\ndeepens her inner certainty that she is \u201cno more to him than them\nslippers\u201d, yet she has a sense, too, that his indifference is deeper\nthan the infatuation of commoner souls. She is immensely interested in\nhim. She has even secret mischievous moments in which she wishes she\ncould get him alone, on a desert island, away from all ties and with\nnobody else in the world to consider, and just drag him off his\npedestal and see him making love like any common man. We all have\nprivate imaginations of that sort. But when it comes to business, to\nthe life that she really leads as distinguished from the life of dreams\nand fancies, she likes Freddy and she likes the Colonel; and she does\nnot like Higgins and Mr. Doolittle. Galatea never does quite like\nPygmalion: his relation to her is too godlike to be altogether\nagreeable.\n".split(/\. |\? /);function Ah(e){return parseInt(e,10)||0}const

The room is\nluxuriously and artistically furnished. The sound of a piano is heard\nin the adjoining room.\n\n[Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has\nceased, Algernon enters.]\n\nALGERNON.\nDid you hear what I was playing, Lane?\n\nLANE.\nI didn\u2019t think it polite to listen, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019m sorry for that, for your sake. I don\u2019t play accurately\u2014any one can\nplay accurately\u2014but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the\npiano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nAnd, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber\nsandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the\nway, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord\nShoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of\nchampagne are entered as having been consumed.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhy is it that at a bachelor\u2019s establishment the servants invariably\ndrink the champagne? I ask merely for information.\n\nLANE.\nI attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often\nobserved that in married households the champagne is rarely of a\nfirst-rate brand.\n\nALGERNON.\nGood heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?\n\nLANE.\nI believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little\nexperience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married\nonce. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and\na young person.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Languidly_._] I don\u2019t know that I am much interested in your family\nlife, Lane.\n\nLANE.\nNo, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it\nmyself.\n\nALGERNON.\nVery natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.\n\nLANE.\nThank you, sir. [Lane goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nLane\u2019s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders\ndon\u2019t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They\nseem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nLANE.\nMr. Ernest Worthing.\n\n[Enter Jack.]\n\n[Lane goes out_._]\n\nALGERNON.\nHow are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?\n\nJACK.\nOh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as\nusual, I see, Algy!\n\nALGERNON.\n[Stiffly_._] I believe it is customary in good society to take some\nslight refreshment at five o\u2019clock. Where have you been since last\nThursday?\n\nJACK.\n[Sitting down on the sofa.] In the country.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhat on earth do you do there?\n\nJACK.\n[Pulling off his gloves_._] When one is in town one amuses oneself.\nWhen one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively\nboring.\n\nALGERNON.\nAnd who are the people you amuse?\n\nJACK.\n[Airily_._] Oh, neighbours, neighbours.\n\nALGERNON.\nGot nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?\n\nJACK.\nPerfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.\n\nALGERNON.\nHow immensely you must amuse them! [Goes over and takes sandwich.] By\nthe way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?\n\nJACK.\nEh? Shropshire? Yes, of course. Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber\nsandwiches? Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is\ncoming to tea?\n\nALGERNON.\nOh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.\n\nJACK.\nHow perfectly delightful!\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won\u2019t quite\napprove of your being here.\n\nJACK.\nMay I ask why?\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly\ndisgraceful. It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.\n\nJACK.\nI am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to\npropose to her.\n\nALGERNON.\nI thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that business.\n\nJACK.\nHow utterly unromantic you are!\n\nALGERNON.\nI really don\u2019t see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic\nto be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.\nWhy, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the\nexcitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If\never I get married, I\u2019ll certainly try to forget the fact.\n\nJACK.\nI have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The Divorce Court was specially\ninvented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh! there is no use speculating on that subject. Divorces are made in\nHeaven\u2014[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich. Algernon at once\ninterferes.] Please don\u2019t touch the cucumber sandwiches. They are\nordered specially for Aunt Augusta. [Takes one and eats it.]\n\nJACK.\nWell, you have been eating them all the time.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is quite a different matter. She is my aunt. [Takes plate from\nbelow.] Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for\nGwendolen. Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.\n\nJACK.\n[Advancing to table and helping himself.] And very good bread and\nbutter it is too.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it\nall. You behave as if you were married to her already. You are not\nmarried to her already, and I don\u2019t think you ever will be.\n\nJACK.\nWhy on earth do you say that?\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.\nGirls don\u2019t think it right.\n\nJACK.\nOh, that is nonsense!\n\nALGERNON.\nIt isn\u2019t. It is a great truth. It accounts for the extraordinary number\nof bachelors that one sees all over the place. In the second place, I\ndon\u2019t give my consent.\n\nJACK.\nYour consent!\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to\nmarry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.\n[Rings bell.]\n\nJACK.\nCecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily! I\ndon\u2019t know any one of the name of Cecily.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nALGERNON.\nBring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the\nlast time he dined here.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Lane goes out.]\n\nJACK.\nDo you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time? I wish\nto goodness you had let me know. I have been writing frantic letters to\nScotland Yard about it. I was very nearly offering a large reward.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard\nup.\n\nJACK.\nThere is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.\n\n[Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver. Algernon takes it at\nonce. Lane goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say. [Opens case and\nexamines it.] However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the\ninscription inside, I find that the thing isn\u2019t yours after all.\n\nJACK.\nOf course it\u2019s mine. [Moving to him.] You have seen me with it a\nhundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written\ninside. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette\ncase.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should\nread and what one shouldn\u2019t. More than half of modern culture depends\non what one shouldn\u2019t read.\n\nJACK.\nI am quite aware of the fact, and I don\u2019t propose to discuss modern\nculture. It isn\u2019t the sort of thing one should talk of in private. I\nsimply want my cigarette case back.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes; but this isn\u2019t your cigarette case. This cigarette case is a\npresent from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn\u2019t\nknow any one of that name.\n\nJACK.\nWell, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.\n\nALGERNON.\nYour aunt!\n\nJACK.\nYes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give\nit back to me, Algy.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Retreating to back of sofa.] But why does she call herself little\nCecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells? [Reading.]\n\u2018From little Cecily with her fondest love.\u2019\n\nJACK.\n[Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.] My dear fellow, what on earth is\nthere in that? Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a\nmatter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You\nseem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is\nabsurd! For Heaven\u2019s sake give me back my cigarette case. [Follows\nAlgernon round the room.]\n\nALGERNON.\nYes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? \u2018From little Cecily,\nwith her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.\u2019 There is no objection, I\nadmit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what\nher size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can\u2019t quite\nmake out. Besides, your name isn\u2019t Jack at all; it is Ernest.\n\nJACK.\nIt isn\u2019t Ernest; it\u2019s Jack.\n\nALGERNON.\nYou have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every\none as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your\nname was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in\nmy life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn\u2019t\nErnest. It\u2019s on your cards. Here is one of them. [Taking it from case.]\n\u2018Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.\u2019 I\u2019ll keep this as a proof that\nyour name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to\nGwendolen, or to any one else. [Puts the card in his pocket.]\n\nJACK.\nWell, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the\ncigarette case was given to me in the country.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt\nCecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come,\nold boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.\n\nJACK.\nMy dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist. It is very\nvulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn\u2019t a dentist. It produces a\nfalse impression.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, that is exactly what dentists always do. Now, go on! Tell me the\nwhole thing. I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a\nconfirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.\n\nJACK.\nBunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon\nas you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack\nin the country.\n\nJACK.\nWell, produce my cigarette case first.\n\nALGERNON.\nHere it is. [Hands cigarette case.] Now produce your explanation, and\npray make it improbable. [Sits on sofa.]\n\nJACK.\nMy dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at\nall. In fact it\u2019s perfectly ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who\nadopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his\ngrand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew. Cecily, who addresses me as her\nuncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,\nlives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable\ngoverness, Miss Prism.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhere is that place in the country, by the way?\n\nJACK.\nThat is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not going to be invited . . .\nI may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.\n\nALGERNON.\nI suspected that, my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire\non two separate occasions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and\nJack in the country?\n\nJACK.\nMy dear Algy, I don\u2019t know whether you will be able to understand my\nreal motives. You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the\nposition of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all\nsubjects. It\u2019s one\u2019s duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly\nbe said to conduce very much to either one\u2019s health or one\u2019s happiness,\nin order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger\nbrother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into\nthe most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure\nand simple.\n\nALGERNON.\nThe truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very\ntedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete\nimpossibility!\n\nJACK.\nThat wouldn\u2019t be at all a bad thing.\n\nALGERNON.\nLiterary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don\u2019t try it. You\nshould leave that to people who haven\u2019t been at a University. They do\nit so well in the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist. I\nwas quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the\nmost advanced Bunburyists I know.\n\nJACK.\nWhat on earth do you mean?\n\nALGERNON.\nYou have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order\nthat you may be able to come up to town as often as you like. I have\ninvented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that\nI may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is\nperfectly invaluable. If it wasn\u2019t for Bunbury\u2019s extraordinary bad\nhealth, for instance, I wouldn\u2019t be able to dine with you at Willis\u2019s\nto-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than\na week.\n\nJACK.\nI haven\u2019t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.\n\nALGERNON.\nI know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations. It is\nvery foolish of you. Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving\ninvitations.\n\nJACK.\nYou had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.\n\nALGERNON.\nI haven\u2019t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind. To\nbegin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to\ndine with one\u2019s own relations. In the second place, whenever I do dine\nthere I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with\neither no woman at all, or two. In the third place, I know perfectly\nwell whom she will place me next to, to-night. She will place me next\nMary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the\ndinner-table. That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even decent\n. . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase. The amount\nof women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly\nscandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one\u2019s clean linen in\npublic. Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I\nnaturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. I want to tell you the\nrules.\n\nJACK.\nI\u2019m not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to\nkill my brother, indeed I think I\u2019ll kill him in any case. Cecily is a\nlittle too much interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I am going\nto get rid of Ernest. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr.\n. . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.\n\nALGERNON.\nNothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get\nmarried, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad\nto know Bunbury. A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very\ntedious time of it.\n\nJACK.\nThat is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is\nthe only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly\nwon\u2019t want to know Bunbury.\n\nALGERNON.\nThen your wife will. You don\u2019t seem to realise, that in married life\nthree is company and two is none.\n\nJACK.\n[Sententiously.] That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the\ncorrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.\n\nJACK.\nFor heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t try to be cynical. It\u2019s perfectly easy to be\ncynical.\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear fellow, it isn\u2019t easy to be anything nowadays. There\u2019s such a\nlot of beastly competition about. [The sound of an electric bell is\nheard.] Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta. Only relatives, or creditors,\never ring in that Wagnerian manner. Now, if I get her out of the way\nfor ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to\nGwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis\u2019s?\n\nJACK.\nI suppose so, if you want to.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not\nserious about meals. It is so shallow of them.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nLANE.\nLady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.\n\n[Algernon goes forward to meet them. Enter Lady Bracknell and\nGwendolen.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nGood afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat\u2019s not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go\ntogether. [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[To Gwendolen.] Dear me, you are smart!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI am always smart! Am I not, Mr. Worthing?\n\nJACK.\nYou\u2019re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nOh! I hope I am not that. It would leave no room for developments, and\nI intend to develop in many directions. [Gwendolen and Jack sit down\ntogether in the corner.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI\u2019m sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call\non dear Lady Harbury. I hadn\u2019t been there since her poor husband\u2019s\ndeath. I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years\nyounger. And now I\u2019ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber\nsandwiches you promised me.\n\nALGERNON.\nCertainly, Aunt Augusta. [Goes over to tea-table.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nWon\u2019t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThanks, mamma, I\u2019m quite comfortable where I am.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Picking up empty plate in horror.] Good heavens! Lane! Why are there\nno cucumber sandwiches? I ordered them specially.\n\nLANE.\n[Gravely.] There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir. I\nwent down twice.\n\nALGERNON.\nNo cucumbers!\n\nLANE.\nNo, sir. Not even for ready money.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat will do, Lane, thank you.\n\nLANE.\nThank you, sir. [Goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers,\nnot even for ready money.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIt really makes no matter, Algernon. I had some crumpets with Lady\nHarbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.\n\nALGERNON.\nI hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIt certainly has changed its colour. From what cause I, of course,\ncannot say. [Algernon crosses and hands tea.] Thank you. I\u2019ve quite a\ntreat for you to-night, Algernon. I am going to send you down with Mary\nFarquhar. She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.\nIt\u2019s delightful to watch them.\n\nALGERNON.\nI am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of\ndining with you to-night after all.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Frowning.] I hope not, Algernon. It would put my table completely out.\nYour uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to\nthat.\n\nALGERNON.\nIt is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment\nto me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor\nfriend Bunbury is very ill again. [Exchanges glances with Jack.] They\nseem to think I should be with him.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIt is very strange. This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad\nhealth.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nWell, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr.\nBunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This\nshilly-shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way\napprove of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid.\nIllness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.\nHealth is the primary duty of life. I am always telling that to your\npoor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any\nimprovement in his ailment goes. I should be much obliged if you would\nask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on\nSaturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me. It is my last\nreception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation,\nparticularly at the end of the season when every one has practically\nsaid whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not\nmuch.\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I\nthink I can promise you he\u2019ll be all right by Saturday. Of course the\nmusic is a great difficulty. You see, if one plays good music, people\ndon\u2019t listen, and if one plays bad music people don\u2019t talk. But I\u2019ll\nrun over the programme I\u2019ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the\nnext room for a moment.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of you. [Rising, and\nfollowing Algernon.] I\u2019m sure the programme will be delightful, after a\nfew expurgations. French songs I cannot possibly allow. People always\nseem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is\nvulgar, or laugh, which is worse. But German sounds a thoroughly\nrespectable language, and indeed, I believe is so. Gwendolen, you will\naccompany me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nCertainly, mamma.\n\n[Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains\nbehind.]\n\nJACK.\nCharming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nPray don\u2019t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing. Whenever people\ntalk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they\nmean something else. And that makes me so nervous.\n\nJACK.\nI _do_ mean something else.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI thought so. In fact, I am never wrong.\n\nJACK.\nAnd I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell\u2019s\ntemporary absence . . .\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI would certainly advise you to do so. Mamma has a way of coming back\nsuddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.\n\nJACK.\n[Nervously.] Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more\nthan any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, I am quite well aware of the fact. And I often wish that in\npublic, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative. For me you have\nalways had an irresistible fascination. Even before I met you I was far\nfrom indifferent to you. [Jack looks at her in amazement.] We live, as\nI hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals. The fact is\nconstantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has\nreached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been\nto love some one of the name of Ernest. There is something in that name\nthat inspires absolute confidence. The moment Algernon first mentioned\nto me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love\nyou.\n\nJACK.\nYou really love me, Gwendolen?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nPassionately!\n\nJACK.\nDarling! You don\u2019t know how happy you\u2019ve made me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMy own Ernest!\n\nJACK.\nBut you don\u2019t really mean to say that you couldn\u2019t love me if my name\nwasn\u2019t Ernest?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nBut your name is Ernest.\n\nJACK.\nYes, I know it is. But supposing it was something else? Do you mean to\nsay you couldn\u2019t love me then?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Glibly.] Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most\nmetaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the\nactual facts of real life, as we know them.\n\nJACK.\nPersonally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don\u2019t much care about\nthe name of Ernest . . . I don\u2019t think the name suits me at all.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nIt suits you perfectly. It is a divine name. It has a music of its own.\nIt produces vibrations.\n\nJACK.\nWell, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of\nother much nicer names. I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nJack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at\nall, indeed. It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations .\n. . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were\nmore than usually plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for\nJohn! And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John. She\nwould probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a\nsingle moment\u2019s solitude. The only really safe name is Ernest.\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen, I must get christened at once\u2014I mean we must get married at\nonce. There is no time to be lost.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMarried, Mr. Worthing?\n\nJACK.\n[Astounded.] Well . . . surely. You know that I love you, and you led\nme to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent\nto me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI adore you. But you haven\u2019t proposed to me yet. Nothing has been said\nat all about marriage. The subject has not even been touched on.\n\nJACK.\nWell . . . may I propose to you now?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI think it would be an admirable opportunity. And to spare you any\npossible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you\nquite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?\n\nJACK.\nYou know what I have got to say to you.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, but you don\u2019t say it.\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen, will you marry me? [Goes on his knees.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nOf course I will, darling. How long you have been about it! I am afraid\nyou have had very little experience in how to propose.\n\nJACK.\nMy own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, but men often propose for practice. I know my brother Gerald does.\nAll my girl-friends tell me so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have,\nErnest! They are quite, quite, blue. I hope you will always look at me\njust like that, especially when there are other people present. [Enter\nLady Bracknell.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMr. Worthing! Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture. It is most\nindecorous.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMamma! [He tries to rise; she restrains him.] I must beg you to retire.\nThis is no place for you. Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished\nyet.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nFinished what, may I ask?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma. [They rise together.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nPardon me, you are not engaged to any one. When you do become engaged\nto some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will\ninform you of the fact. An engagement should come on a young girl as a\nsurprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be. It is hardly a\nmatter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . . And now I\nhave a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing. While I am making\nthese inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the\ncarriage.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Reproachfully.] Mamma!\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIn the carriage, Gwendolen! [Gwendolen goes to the door. She and Jack\nblow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknell\u2019s back. Lady Bracknell\nlooks vaguely about as if she could not understand what the noise was.\nFinally turns round.] Gwendolen, the carriage!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, mamma. [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Sitting down.] You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.\n\n[Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil.]\n\nJACK.\nThank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Pencil and note-book in hand.] I feel bound to tell you that you are\nnot down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same\nlist as the dear Duchess of Bolton has. We work together, in fact.\nHowever, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be\nwhat a really affectionate mother requires. Do you smoke?\n\nJACK.\nWell, yes, I must admit I smoke.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some\nkind. There are far too many idle men in London as it is. How old are\nyou?\n\nJACK.\nTwenty-nine.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nA very good age to be married at. I have always been of opinion that a\nman who desires to get married should know either everything or\nnothing. Which do you know?\n\nJACK.\n[After some hesitation.] I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI am pleased to hear it. I do not approve of anything that tampers with\nnatural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it\nand the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is\nradically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education\nproduces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious\ndanger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in\nGrosvenor Square. What is your income?\n\nJACK.\nBetween seven and eight thousand a year.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Makes a note in her book.] In land, or in investments?\n\nJACK.\nIn investments, chiefly.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat is satisfactory. What between the duties expected of one during\none\u2019s lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one\u2019s death, land\nhas ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure. It gives one position,\nand prevents one from keeping it up. That\u2019s all that can be said about\nland.\n\nJACK.\nI have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about\nfifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don\u2019t depend on that for my\nreal income. In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the\nonly people who make anything out of it.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nA country house! How many bedrooms? Well, that point can be cleared up\nafterwards. You have a town house, I hope? A girl with a simple,\nunspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected to reside in\nthe country.\n\nJACK.\nWell, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to\nLady Bloxham. Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six\nmonths\u2019 notice.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nLady Bloxham? I don\u2019t know her.\n\nJACK.\nOh, she goes about very little. She is a lady considerably advanced in\nyears.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nAh, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of character. What\nnumber in Belgrave Square?\n\nJACK.\n149.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Shaking her head.] The unfashionable side. I thought there was\nsomething. However, that could easily be altered.\n\nJACK.\nDo you mean the fashion, or the side?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Sternly.] Both, if necessary, I presume. What are your politics?\n\nJACK.\nWell, I am afraid I really have none. I am a Liberal Unionist.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nOh, they count as Tories. They dine with us. Or come in the evening, at\nany rate. Now to minor matters. Are your parents living?\n\nJACK.\nI have lost both my parents.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nTo lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to\nlose both looks like carelessness. Who was your father? He was\nevidently a man of some wealth. Was he born in what the Radical papers\ncall the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the\naristocracy?\n\nJACK.\nI am afraid I really don\u2019t know. The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I\nhad lost my parents. It would be nearer the truth to say that my\nparents seem to have lost me . . . I don\u2019t actually know who I am by\nbirth. I was . . . well, I was found.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nFound!\n\nJACK.\nThe late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and\nkindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because\nhe happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at\nthe time. Worthing is a place in Sussex. It is a seaside resort.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nWhere did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for\nthis seaside resort find you?\n\nJACK.\n[Gravely.] In a hand-bag.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nA hand-bag?\n\nJACK.\n[Very seriously.] Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in a hand-bag\u2014a somewhat\nlarge, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it\u2014an ordinary hand-bag\nin fact.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIn what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew come across this\nordinary hand-bag?\n\nJACK.\nIn the cloak-room at Victoria Station. It was given to him in mistake\nfor his own.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe cloak-room at Victoria Station?\n\nJACK.\nYes. The Brighton line.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe line is immaterial. Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat\nbewildered by what you have just told me. To be born, or at any rate\nbred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to\ndisplay a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that\nreminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution. And I\npresume you know what that unfortunate movement led to? As for the\nparticular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a\nrailway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion\u2014has\nprobably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now\u2014but it could\nhardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in\ngood society.\n\nJACK.\nMay I ask you then what you would advise me to do? I need hardly say I\nwould do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen\u2019s happiness.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire some\nrelations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce\nat any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.\n\nJACK.\nWell, I don\u2019t see how I could possibly manage to do that. I can produce\nthe hand-bag at any moment. It is in my dressing-room at home. I really\nthink that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMe, sir! What has it to do with me? You can hardly imagine that I and\nLord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter\u2014a girl brought\nup with the utmost care\u2014to marry into a cloak-room, and form an\nalliance with a parcel? Good morning, Mr. Worthing!\n\n[Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation.]\n\nJACK.\nGood morning! [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up the Wedding\nMarch. Jack looks perfectly furious, and goes to the door.] For\ngoodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t play that ghastly tune, Algy. How idiotic you are!\n\n[The music stops and Algernon enters cheerily.]\n\nALGERNON.\nDidn\u2019t it go off all right, old boy? You don\u2019t mean to say Gwendolen\nrefused you? I know it is a way she has. She is always refusing people.\nI think it is most ill-natured of her.\n\nJACK.\nOh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet. As far as she is concerned, we\nare engaged. Her mother is perfectly unbearable. Never met such a\nGorgon . . . I don\u2019t really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am quite\nsure that Lady Bracknell is one. In any case, she is a monster, without\nbeing a myth, which is rather unfair . . . I beg your pardon, Algy, I\nsuppose I shouldn\u2019t talk about your own aunt in that way before you.\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused. It is the only thing\nthat makes me put up with them at all. Relations are simply a tedious\npack of people, who haven\u2019t got the remotest knowledge of how to live,\nnor the smallest instinct about when to die.\n\nJACK.\nOh, that is nonsense!\n\nALGERNON.\nIt isn\u2019t!\n\nJACK.\nWell, I won\u2019t argue about the matter. You always want to argue about\nthings.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is exactly what things were originally made for.\n\nJACK.\nUpon my word, if I thought that, I\u2019d shoot myself . . . [A pause.] You\ndon\u2019t think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother\nin about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?\n\nALGERNON.\nAll women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man\ndoes. That\u2019s his.\n\nJACK.\nIs that clever?\n\nALGERNON.\nIt is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in\ncivilised life should be.\n\nJACK.\nI am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays. You\ncan\u2019t go anywhere without meeting clever people. The thing has become\nan absolute public nuisance. I wish to goodness we had a few fools\nleft.\n\nALGERNON.\nWe have.\n\nJACK.\nI should extremely like to meet them. What do they talk about?\n\nALGERNON.\nThe fools? Oh! about the clever people, of course.\n\nJACK.\nWhat fools!\n\nALGERNON.\nBy the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being Ernest in\ntown, and Jack in the country?\n\nJACK.\n[In a very patronising manner.] My dear fellow, the truth isn\u2019t quite\nthe sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl. What\nextraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!\n\nALGERNON.\nThe only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is\npretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.\n\nJACK.\nOh, that is nonsense.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhat about your brother? What about the profligate Ernest?\n\nJACK.\nOh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him. I\u2019ll say he\ndied in Paris of apoplexy. Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite\nsuddenly, don\u2019t they?\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, but it\u2019s hereditary, my dear fellow. It\u2019s a sort of thing that\nruns in families. You had much better say a severe chill.\n\nJACK.\nYou are sure a severe chill isn\u2019t hereditary, or anything of that kind?\n\nALGERNON.\nOf course it isn\u2019t!\n\nJACK.\nVery well, then. My poor brother Ernest is carried off suddenly, in\nParis, by a severe chill. That gets rid of him.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little too much\ninterested in your poor brother Ernest? Won\u2019t she feel his loss a good\ndeal?\n\nJACK.\nOh, that is all right. Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad\nto say. She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays no\nattention at all to her lessons.\n\nALGERNON.\nI would rather like to see Cecily.\n\nJACK.\nI will take very good care you never do. She is excessively pretty, and\nshe is only just eighteen.\n\nALGERNON.\nHave you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty ward\nwho is only just eighteen?\n\nJACK.\nOh! one doesn\u2019t blurt these things out to people. Cecily and Gwendolen\nare perfectly certain to be extremely great friends. I\u2019ll bet you\nanything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be\ncalling each other sister.\n\nALGERNON.\nWomen only do that when they have called each other a lot of other\nthings first. Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at\nWillis\u2019s, we really must go and dress. Do you know it is nearly seven?\n\nJACK.\n[Irritably.] Oh! It always is nearly seven.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I\u2019m hungry.\n\nJACK.\nI never knew you when you weren\u2019t . . .\n\nALGERNON.\nWhat shall we do after dinner? Go to a theatre?\n\nJACK.\nOh no! I loathe listening.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, let us go to the Club?\n\nJACK.\nOh, no! I hate talking.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?\n\nJACK.\nOh, no! I can\u2019t bear looking at things. It is so silly.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, what shall we do?\n\nJACK.\nNothing!\n\nALGERNON.\nIt is awfully hard work doing nothing. However, I don\u2019t mind hard work\nwhere there is no definite object of any kind.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nLANE.\nMiss Fairfax.\n\n[Enter Gwendolen. Lane goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nGwendolen, upon my word!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAlgy, kindly turn your back. I have something very particular to say to\nMr. Worthing.\n\nALGERNON.\nReally, Gwendolen, I don\u2019t think I can allow this at all.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAlgy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life. You\nare not quite old enough to do that. [Algernon retires to the\nfireplace.]\n\nJACK.\nMy own darling!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nErnest, we may never be married. From the expression on mamma\u2019s face I\nfear we never shall. Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their\nchildren say to them. The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast\ndying out. Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age\nof three. But although she may prevent us from becoming man and wife,\nand I may marry some one else, and marry often, nothing that she can\npossibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.\n\nJACK.\nDear Gwendolen!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThe story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma, with\nunpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my\nnature. Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination. The\nsimplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to\nme. Your town address at the Albany I have. What is your address in the\ncountry?\n\nJACK.\nThe Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.\n\n[Algernon, who has been carefully listening, smiles to himself, and\nwrites the address on his shirt-cuff. Then picks up the Railway Guide.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThere is a good postal service, I suppose? It may be necessary to do\nsomething desperate. That of course will require serious consideration.\nI will communicate with you daily.\n\nJACK.\nMy own one!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nHow long do you remain in town?\n\nJACK.\nTill Monday.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nGood! Algy, you may turn round now.\n\nALGERNON.\nThanks, I\u2019ve turned round already.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYou may also ring the bell.\n\nJACK.\nYou will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nCertainly.\n\nJACK.\n[To Lane, who now enters.] I will see Miss Fairfax out.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Jack and Gwendolen go off.]\n\n[Lane presents several letters on a salver to Algernon. It is to be\nsurmised that they are bills, as Algernon, after looking at the\nenvelopes, tears them up.]\n\nALGERNON.\nA glass of sherry, Lane.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nTo-morrow, Lane, I\u2019m going Bunburying.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nI shall probably not be back till Monday. You can put up my dress\nclothes, my smoking jacket, and all the Bunbury suits . . .\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Handing sherry.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.\n\nLANE.\nIt never is, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nLane, you\u2019re a perfect pessimist.\n\nLANE.\nI do my best to give satisfaction, sir.\n\n[Enter Jack. Lane goes off.]\n\nJACK.\nThere\u2019s a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl I ever cared for\nin my life. [Algernon is laughing immoderately.] What on earth are you\nso amused at?\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, I\u2019m a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that is all.\n\nJACK.\nIf you don\u2019t take care, your friend Bunbury will get you into a serious\nscrape some day.\n\nALGERNON.\nI love scrapes. They are the only things that are never serious.\n\nJACK.\nOh, that\u2019s nonsense, Algy. You never talk anything but nonsense.\n\nALGERNON.\nNobody ever does.\n\n[Jack looks indignantly at him, and leaves the room. Algernon lights a\ncigarette, reads his shirt-cuff, and smiles.]\n\nACT DROP\n\n\n\n\nSECOND ACT\n\n\nSCENE\n\nGarden at the Manor House. A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the\nhouse. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year,\nJuly. Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a\nlarge yew-tree.\n\n[Miss Prism discovered seated at the table. Cecily is at the back\nwatering flowers.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Calling.] Cecily, Cecily! Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the\nwatering of flowers is rather Moulton\u2019s duty than yours? Especially at\na moment when intellectual pleasures await you. Your German grammar is\non the table. Pray open it at page fifteen. We will repeat yesterday\u2019s\nlesson.\n\nCECILY.\n[Coming over very slowly.] But I don\u2019t like German. It isn\u2019t at all a\nbecoming language. I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after\nmy German lesson.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nChild, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve\nyourself in every way. He laid particular stress on your German, as he\nwas leaving for town yesterday. Indeed, he always lays stress on your\nGerman when he is leaving for town.\n\nCECILY.\nDear Uncle Jack is so very serious! Sometimes he is so serious that I\nthink he cannot be quite well.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Drawing herself up.] Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his\ngravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so\ncomparatively young as he is. I know no one who has a higher sense of\nduty and responsibility.\n\nCECILY.\nI suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are\ntogether.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nCecily! I am surprised at you. Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his\nlife. Idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his\nconversation. You must remember his constant anxiety about that\nunfortunate young man his brother.\n\nCECILY.\nI wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother,\nto come down here sometimes. We might have a good influence over him,\nMiss Prism. I am sure you certainly would. You know German, and\ngeology, and things of that kind influence a man very much. [Cecily\nbegins to write in her diary.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Shaking her head.] I do not think that even I could produce any effect\non a character that according to his own brother\u2019s admission is\nirretrievably weak and vacillating. Indeed I am not sure that I would\ndesire to reclaim him. I am not in favour of this modern mania for\nturning bad people into good people at a moment\u2019s notice. As a man sows\nso let him reap. You must put away your diary, Cecily. I really don\u2019t\nsee why you should keep a diary at all.\n\nCECILY.\nI keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life. If I\ndidn\u2019t write them down, I should probably forget all about them.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nMemory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.\n\nCECILY.\nYes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and\ncouldn\u2019t possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible\nfor nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nDo not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one\nmyself in earlier days.\n\nCECILY.\nDid you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it\ndid not end happily? I don\u2019t like novels that end happily. They depress\nme so much.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThe good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction\nmeans.\n\nCECILY.\nI suppose so. But it seems very unfair. And was your novel ever\npublished?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nAlas! no. The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned. [Cecily starts.]\nI use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid. To your work, child,\nthese speculations are profitless.\n\nCECILY.\n[Smiling.] But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Rising and advancing.] Dr. Chasuble! This is indeed a pleasure.\n\n[Enter Canon Chasuble.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAnd how are we this morning? Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well?\n\nCECILY.\nMiss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache. I think it\nwould do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the Park,\nDr. Chasuble.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nCecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.\n\nCECILY.\nNo, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively that you had\na headache. Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about my German\nlesson, when the Rector came in.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nI hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, I am afraid I am.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nThat is strange. Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism\u2019s pupil, I\nwould hang upon her lips. [Miss Prism glares.] I spoke\nmetaphorically.\u2014My metaphor was drawn from bees. Ahem! Mr. Worthing, I\nsuppose, has not returned from town yet?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nWe do not expect him till Monday afternoon.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAh yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London. He is not one\nof those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that\nunfortunate young man his brother seems to be. But I must not disturb\nEgeria and her pupil any longer.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nEgeria? My name is L\xe6titia, Doctor.\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Bowing.] A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan authors. I\nshall see you both no doubt at Evensong?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nI think, dear Doctor, I will have a stroll with you. I find I have a\nheadache after all, and a walk might do it good.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nWith pleasure, Miss Prism, with pleasure. We might go as far as the\nschools and back.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThat would be delightful. Cecily, you will read your Political Economy\nin my absence. The chapter on the Fall of the Rupee you may omit. It is\nsomewhat too sensational. Even these metallic problems have their\nmelodramatic side.\n\n[Goes down the garden with Dr. Chasuble.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Picks up books and throws them back on table.] Horrid Political\nEconomy! Horrid Geography! Horrid, horrid German!\n\n[Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nMr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station. He has\nbrought his luggage with him.\n\nCECILY.\n[Takes the card and reads it.] \u2018Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany,\nW.\u2019 Uncle Jack\u2019s brother! Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in town?\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, Miss. He seemed very much disappointed. I mentioned that you and\nMiss Prism were in the garden. He said he was anxious to speak to you\nprivately for a moment.\n\nCECILY.\nAsk Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here. I suppose you had better talk to\nthe housekeeper about a room for him.\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, Miss.\n\n[Merriman goes off.]\n\nCECILY.\nI have never met any really wicked person before. I feel rather\nfrightened. I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.\n\n[Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.] He does!\n\nALGERNON.\n[Raising his hat.] You are my little cousin Cecily, I\u2019m sure.\n\nCECILY.\nYou are under some strange mistake. I am not little. In fact, I believe\nI am more than usually tall for my age. [Algernon is rather taken\naback.] But I am your cousin Cecily. You, I see from your card, are\nUncle Jack\u2019s brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily. You mustn\u2019t think\nthat I am wicked.\n\nCECILY.\nIf you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very\ninexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life,\npretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would\nbe hypocrisy.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Looks at her in amazement.] Oh! Of course I have been rather reckless.\n\nCECILY.\nI am glad to hear it.\n\nALGERNON.\nIn fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own\nsmall way.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it must\nhave been very pleasant.\n\nALGERNON.\nIt is much pleasanter being here with you.\n\nCECILY.\nI can\u2019t understand how you are here at all. Uncle Jack won\u2019t be back\ntill Monday afternoon.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is a great disappointment. I am obliged to go up by the first\ntrain on Monday morning. I have a business appointment that I am\nanxious . . . to miss?\n\nCECILY.\nCouldn\u2019t you miss it anywhere but in London?\n\nALGERNON.\nNo: the appointment is in London.\n\nCECILY.\nWell, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a business\nengagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life, but\nstill I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives. I know he\nwants to speak to you about your emigrating.\n\nALGERNON.\nAbout my what?\n\nCECILY.\nYour emigrating. He has gone up to buy your outfit.\n\nALGERNON.\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t let Jack buy my outfit. He has no taste in\nneckties at all.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think you will require neckties. Uncle Jack is sending you to\nAustralia.\n\nALGERNON.\nAustralia! I\u2019d sooner die.\n\nCECILY.\nWell, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have to\nchoose between this world, the next world, and Australia.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, well! The accounts I have received of Australia and the next world,\nare not particularly encouraging. This world is good enough for me,\ncousin Cecily.\n\nCECILY.\nYes, but are you good enough for it?\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not that. That is why I want you to reform me. You might\nmake that your mission, if you don\u2019t mind, cousin Cecily.\n\nCECILY.\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve no time, this afternoon.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?\n\nCECILY.\nIt is rather Quixotic of you. But I think you should try.\n\nALGERNON.\nI will. I feel better already.\n\nCECILY.\nYou are looking a little worse.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is because I am hungry.\n\nCECILY.\nHow thoughtless of me. I should have remembered that when one is going\nto lead an entirely new life, one requires regular and wholesome meals.\nWon\u2019t you come in?\n\nALGERNON.\nThank you. Might I have a buttonhole first? I never have any appetite\nunless I have a buttonhole first.\n\nCECILY.\nA Marechal Niel? [Picks up scissors.]\n\nALGERNON.\nNo, I\u2019d sooner have a pink rose.\n\nCECILY.\nWhy? [Cuts a flower.]\n\nALGERNON.\nBecause you are like a pink rose, Cousin Cecily.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think it can be right for you to talk to me like that. Miss\nPrism never says such things to me.\n\nALGERNON.\nThen Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady. [Cecily puts the rose in\nhis buttonhole.] You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.\n\nCECILY.\nMiss Prism says that all good looks are a snare.\n\nALGERNON.\nThey are a snare that every sensible man would like to be caught in.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, I don\u2019t think I would care to catch a sensible man. I shouldn\u2019t\nknow what to talk to him about.\n\n[They pass into the house. Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\nYou are too much alone, dear Dr. Chasuble. You should get married. A\nmisanthrope I can understand\u2014a womanthrope, never!\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[With a scholar\u2019s shudder.] Believe me, I do not deserve so neologistic\na phrase. The precept as well as the practice of the Primitive Church\nwas distinctly against matrimony.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Sententiously.] That is obviously the reason why the Primitive Church\nhas not lasted up to the present day. And you do not seem to realise,\ndear Doctor, that by persistently remaining single, a man converts\nhimself into a permanent public temptation. Men should be more careful;\nthis very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nBut is a man not equally attractive when married?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nNo married man is ever attractive except to his wife.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAnd often, I\u2019ve been told, not even to her.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThat depends on the intellectual sympathies of the woman. Maturity can\nalways be depended on. Ripeness can be trusted. Young women are green.\n[Dr. Chasuble starts.] I spoke horticulturally. My metaphor was drawn\nfrom fruits. But where is Cecily?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nPerhaps she followed us to the schools.\n\n[Enter Jack slowly from the back of the garden. He is dressed in the\ndeepest mourning, with crape hatband and black gloves.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\nMr. Worthing!\n\nCHASUBLE.\nMr. Worthing?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThis is indeed a surprise. We did not look for you till Monday\nafternoon.\n\nJACK.\n[Shakes Miss Prism\u2019s hand in a tragic manner.] I have returned sooner\nthan I expected. Dr. Chasuble, I hope you are well?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nDear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of woe does not betoken some\nterrible calamity?\n\nJACK.\nMy brother.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nMore shameful debts and extravagance?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nStill leading his life of pleasure?\n\nJACK.\n[Shaking his head.] Dead!\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYour brother Ernest dead?\n\nJACK.\nQuite dead.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nWhat a lesson for him! I trust he will profit by it.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nMr. Worthing, I offer you my sincere condolence. You have at least the\nconsolation of knowing that you were always the most generous and\nforgiving of brothers.\n\nJACK.\nPoor Ernest! He had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nVery sad indeed. Were you with him at the end?\n\nJACK.\nNo. He died abroad; in Paris, in fact. I had a telegram last night from\nthe manager of the Grand Hotel.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nWas the cause of death mentioned?\n\nJACK.\nA severe chill, it seems.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nAs a man sows, so shall he reap.\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Raising his hand.] Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity! None of us are\nperfect. I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts. Will the\ninterment take place here?\n\nJACK.\nNo. He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nIn Paris! [Shakes his head.] I fear that hardly points to any very\nserious state of mind at the last. You would no doubt wish me to make\nsome slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next Sunday.\n[Jack presses his hand convulsively.] My sermon on the meaning of the\nmanna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion, joyful,\nor, as in the present case, distressing. [All sigh.] I have preached it\nat harvest celebrations, christenings, confirmations, on days of\nhumiliation and festal days. The last time I delivered it was in the\nCathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for the\nPrevention of Discontent among the Upper Orders. The Bishop, who was\npresent, was much struck by some of the analogies I drew.\n\nJACK.\nAh! that reminds me, you mentioned christenings I think, Dr. Chasuble?\nI suppose you know how to christen all right? [Dr. Chasuble looks\nastounded.] I mean, of course, you are continually christening, aren\u2019t\nyou?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nIt is, I regret to say, one of the Rector\u2019s most constant duties in\nthis parish. I have often spoken to the poorer classes on the subject.\nBut they don\u2019t seem to know what thrift is.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nBut is there any particular infant in whom you are interested, Mr.\nWorthing? Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?\n\nJACK.\nOh yes.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Bitterly.] People who live entirely for pleasure usually are.\n\nJACK.\nBut it is not for any child, dear Doctor. I am very fond of children.\nNo! the fact is, I would like to be christened myself, this afternoon,\nif you have nothing better to do.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nBut surely, Mr. Worthing, you have been christened already?\n\nJACK.\nI don\u2019t remember anything about it.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nBut have you any grave doubts on the subject?\n\nJACK.\nI certainly intend to have. Of course I don\u2019t know if the thing would\nbother you in any way, or if you think I am a little too old now.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nNot at all. The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of adults is a\nperfectly canonical practice.\n\nJACK.\nImmersion!\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYou need have no apprehensions. Sprinkling is all that is necessary, or\nindeed I think advisable. Our weather is so changeable. At what hour\nwould you wish the ceremony performed?\n\nJACK.\nOh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nPerfectly, perfectly! In fact I have two similar ceremonies to perform\nat that time. A case of twins that occurred recently in one of the\noutlying cottages on your own estate. Poor Jenkins the carter, a most\nhard-working man.\n\nJACK.\nOh! I don\u2019t see much fun in being christened along with other babies.\nIt would be childish. Would half-past five do?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAdmirably! Admirably! [Takes out watch.] And now, dear Mr. Worthing, I\nwill not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow. I would merely beg\nyou not to be too much bowed down by grief. What seem to us bitter\ntrials are often blessings in disguise.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThis seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.\n\n[Enter Cecily from the house.]\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack! Oh, I am pleased to see you back. But what horrid clothes\nyou have got on! Do go and change them.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nCecily!\n\nCHASUBLE.\nMy child! my child! [Cecily goes towards Jack; he kisses her brow in a\nmelancholy manner.]\n\nCECILY.\nWhat is the matter, Uncle Jack? Do look happy! You look as if you had\ntoothache, and I have got such a surprise for you. Who do you think is\nin the dining-room? Your brother!\n\nJACK.\nWho?\n\nCECILY.\nYour brother Ernest. He arrived about half an hour ago.\n\nJACK.\nWhat nonsense! I haven\u2019t got a brother.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, don\u2019t say that. However badly he may have behaved to you in the\npast he is still your brother. You couldn\u2019t be so heartless as to\ndisown him. I\u2019ll tell him to come out. And you will shake hands with\nhim, won\u2019t you, Uncle Jack? [Runs back into the house.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nThese are very joyful tidings.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nAfter we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden return seems to\nme peculiarly distressing.\n\nJACK.\nMy brother is in the dining-room? I don\u2019t know what it all means. I\nthink it is perfectly absurd.\n\n[Enter Algernon and Cecily hand in hand. They come slowly up to Jack.]\n\nJACK.\nGood heavens! [Motions Algernon away.]\n\nALGERNON.\nBrother John, I have come down from town to tell you that I am very\nsorry for all the trouble I have given you, and that I intend to lead a\nbetter life in the future. [Jack glares at him and does not take his\nhand.]\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother\u2019s hand?\n\nJACK.\nNothing will induce me to take his hand. I think his coming down here\ndisgraceful. He knows perfectly well why.\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack, do be nice. There is some good in every one. Ernest has\njust been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whom he\ngoes to visit so often. And surely there must be much good in one who\nis kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a\nbed of pain.\n\nJACK.\nOh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?\n\nCECILY.\nYes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible state\nof health.\n\nJACK.\nBunbury! Well, I won\u2019t have him talk to you about Bunbury or about\nanything else. It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic.\n\nALGERNON.\nOf course I admit that the faults were all on my side. But I must say\nthat I think that Brother John\u2019s coldness to me is peculiarly painful.\nI expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering it is\nthe first time I have come here.\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack, if you don\u2019t shake hands with Ernest I will never forgive\nyou.\n\nJACK.\nNever forgive me?\n\nCECILY.\nNever, never, never!\n\nJACK.\nWell, this is the last time I shall ever do it. [Shakes with Algernon\nand glares.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nIt\u2019s pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation? I think\nwe might leave the two brothers together.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nCecily, you will come with us.\n\nCECILY.\nCertainly, Miss Prism. My little task of reconciliation is over.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYou have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nWe must not be premature in our judgments.\n\nCECILY.\nI feel very happy. [They all go off except Jack and Algernon.]\n\nJACK.\nYou young scoundrel, Algy, you must get out of this place as soon as\npossible. I don\u2019t allow any Bunburying here.\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nI have put Mr. Ernest\u2019s things in the room next to yours, sir. I\nsuppose that is all right?\n\nJACK.\nWhat?\n\nMERRIMAN.\nMr. Ernest\u2019s luggage, sir. I have unpacked it and put it in the room\nnext to your own.\n\nJACK.\nHis luggage?\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, sir. Three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two hat-boxes, and a\nlarge luncheon-basket.\n\nALGERNON.\nI am afraid I can\u2019t stay more than a week this time.\n\nJACK.\nMerriman, order the dog-cart at once. Mr. Ernest has been suddenly\ncalled back to town.\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, sir. [Goes back into the house.]\n\nALGERNON.\nWhat a fearful liar you are, Jack. I have not been called back to town\nat all.\n\nJACK.\nYes, you have.\n\nALGERNON.\nI haven\u2019t heard any one call me.\n\nJACK.\nYour duty as a gentleman calls you back.\n\nALGERNON.\nMy duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the\nsmallest degree.\n\nJACK.\nI can quite understand that.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, Cecily is a darling.\n\nJACK.\nYou are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that. I don\u2019t like it.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I don\u2019t like your clothes. You look perfectly ridiculous in them.\nWhy on earth don\u2019t you go up and change? It is perfectly childish to be\nin deep mourning for a man who is actually staying for a whole week\nwith you in your house as a guest. I call it grotesque.\n\nJACK.\nYou are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest or\nanything else. You have got to leave . . . by the four-five train.\n\nALGERNON.\nI certainly won\u2019t leave you so long as you are in mourning. It would be\nmost unfriendly. If I were in mourning you would stay with me, I\nsuppose. I should think it very unkind if you didn\u2019t.\n\nJACK.\nWell, will you go if I change my clothes?\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, if you are not too long. I never saw anybody take so long to\ndress, and with such little result.\n\nJACK.\nWell, at any rate, that is better than being always over-dressed as you\nare.\n\nALGERNON.\nIf I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being\nalways immensely over-educated.\n\nJACK.\nYour vanity is ridiculous, your conduct an outrage, and your presence\nin my garden utterly absurd. However, you have got to catch the\nfour-five, and I hope you will have a pleasant journey back to town.\nThis Bunburying, as you call it, has not been a great success for you.\n\n[Goes into the house.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI think it has been a great success. I\u2019m in love with Cecily, and that\nis everything.\n\n[Enter Cecily at the back of the garden. She picks up the can and\nbegins to water the flowers.] But I must see her before I go, and make\narrangements for another Bunbury. Ah, there she is.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, I merely came back to water the roses. I thought you were with\nUncle Jack.\n\nALGERNON.\nHe\u2019s gone to order the dog-cart for me.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?\n\nALGERNON.\nHe\u2019s going to send me away.\n\nCECILY.\nThen have we got to part?\n\nALGERNON.\nI am afraid so. It\u2019s a very painful parting.\n\nCECILY.\nIt is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very\nbrief space of time. The absence of old friends one can endure with\nequanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has\njust been introduced is almost unbearable.\n\nALGERNON.\nThank you.\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nThe dog-cart is at the door, sir. [Algernon looks appealingly at\nCecily.]\n\nCECILY.\nIt can wait, Merriman for . . . five minutes.\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, Miss. [Exit Merriman.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite frankly and\nopenly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible\npersonification of absolute perfection.\n\nCECILY.\nI think your frankness does you great credit, Ernest. If you will allow\nme, I will copy your remarks into my diary. [Goes over to table and\nbegins writing in diary.]\n\nALGERNON.\nDo you really keep a diary? I\u2019d give anything to look at it. May I?\n\nCECILY.\nOh no. [Puts her hand over it.] You see, it is simply a very young\ngirl\u2019s record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently\nmeant for publication. When it appears in volume form I hope you will\norder a copy. But pray, Ernest, don\u2019t stop. I delight in taking down\nfrom dictation. I have reached \u2018absolute perfection\u2019. You can go on. I\nam quite ready for more.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Somewhat taken aback.] Ahem! Ahem!\n\nCECILY.\nOh, don\u2019t cough, Ernest. When one is dictating one should speak\nfluently and not cough. Besides, I don\u2019t know how to spell a cough.\n[Writes as Algernon speaks.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[Speaking very rapidly.] Cecily, ever since I first looked upon your\nwonderful and incomparable beauty, I have dared to love you wildly,\npassionately, devotedly, hopelessly.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think that you should tell me that you love me wildly,\npassionately, devotedly, hopelessly. Hopelessly doesn\u2019t seem to make\nmuch sense, does it?\n\nALGERNON.\nCecily!\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nThe dog-cart is waiting, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nTell it to come round next week, at the same hour.\n\nMERRIMAN.\n[Looks at Cecily, who makes no sign.] Yes, sir.\n\n[Merriman retires.]\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack would be very much annoyed if he knew you were staying on\ntill next week, at the same hour.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, I don\u2019t care about Jack. I don\u2019t care for anybody in the whole\nworld but you. I love you, Cecily. You will marry me, won\u2019t you?\n\nCECILY.\nYou silly boy! Of course. Why, we have been engaged for the last three\nmonths.\n\nALGERNON.\nFor the last three months?\n\nCECILY.\nYes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut how did we become engaged?\n\nCECILY.\nWell, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that he had a\nyounger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have formed\nthe chief topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism. And of\ncourse a man who is much talked about is always very attractive. One\nfeels there must be something in him, after all. I daresay it was\nfoolish of me, but I fell in love with you, Ernest.\n\nALGERNON.\nDarling! And when was the engagement actually settled?\n\nCECILY.\nOn the 14th of February last. Worn out by your entire ignorance of my\nexistence, I determined to end the matter one way or the other, and\nafter a long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear old\ntree here. The next day I bought this little ring in your name, and\nthis is the little bangle with the true lover\u2019s knot I promised you\nalways to wear.\n\nALGERNON.\nDid I give you this? It\u2019s very pretty, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCECILY.\nYes, you\u2019ve wonderfully good taste, Ernest. It\u2019s the excuse I\u2019ve always\ngiven for your leading such a bad life. And this is the box in which I\nkeep all your dear letters. [Kneels at table, opens box, and produces\nletters tied up with blue ribbon.]\n\nALGERNON.\nMy letters! But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you any\nletters.\n\nCECILY.\nYou need hardly remind me of that, Ernest. I remember only too well\nthat I was forced to write your letters for you. I wrote always three\ntimes a week, and sometimes oftener.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, do let me read them, Cecily?\n\nCECILY.\nOh, I couldn\u2019t possibly. They would make you far too conceited.\n[Replaces box.] The three you wrote me after I had broken off the\nengagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I can\nhardly read them without crying a little.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut was our engagement ever broken off?\n\nCECILY.\nOf course it was. On the 22nd of last March. You can see the entry if\nyou like. [Shows diary.] \u2018To-day I broke off my engagement with Ernest.\nI feel it is better to do so. The weather still continues charming.\u2019\n\nALGERNON.\nBut why on earth did you break it off? What had I done? I had done\nnothing at all. Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed to hear you broke it\noff. Particularly when the weather was so charming.\n\nCECILY.\nIt would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it hadn\u2019t been\nbroken off at least once. But I forgave you before the week was out.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Crossing to her, and kneeling.] What a perfect angel you are, Cecily.\n\nCECILY.\nYou dear romantic boy. [He kisses her, she puts her fingers through his\nhair.] I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, darling, with a little help from others.\n\nCECILY.\nI am so glad.\n\nALGERNON.\nYou\u2019ll never break off our engagement again, Cecily?\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think I could break it off now that I have actually met you.\nBesides, of course, there is the question of your name.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, of course. [Nervously.]\n\nCECILY.\nYou must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish\ndream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest. [Algernon rises,\nCecily also.] There is something in that name that seems to inspire\nabsolute confidence. I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not\ncalled Ernest.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I had\nsome other name?\n\nCECILY.\nBut what name?\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, any name you like\u2014Algernon\u2014for instance . . .\n\nCECILY.\nBut I don\u2019t like the name of Algernon.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, my own dear, sweet, loving little darling, I really can\u2019t see why\nyou should object to the name of Algernon. It is not at all a bad name.\nIn fact, it is rather an aristocratic name. Half of the chaps who get\ninto the Bankruptcy Court are called Algernon. But seriously, Cecily .\n. . [Moving to her] . . . if my name was Algy, couldn\u2019t you love me?\n\nCECILY.\n[Rising.] I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire your character,\nbut I fear that I should not be able to give you my undivided\nattention.\n\nALGERNON.\nAhem! Cecily! [Picking up hat.] Your Rector here is, I suppose,\nthoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites and ceremonials\nof the Church?\n\nCECILY.\nOh, yes. Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man. He has never written a\nsingle book, so you can imagine how much he knows.\n\nALGERNON.\nI must see him at once on a most important christening\u2014I mean on most\nimportant business.\n\nCECILY.\nOh!\n\nALGERNON.\nI shan\u2019t be away more than half an hour.\n\nCECILY.\nConsidering that we have been engaged since February the 14th, and that\nI only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is rather hard\nthat you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour. Couldn\u2019t\nyou make it twenty minutes?\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019ll be back in no time.\n\n[Kisses her and rushes down the garden.]\n\nCECILY.\nWhat an impetuous boy he is! I like his hair so much. I must enter his\nproposal in my diary.\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nA Miss Fairfax has just called to see Mr. Worthing. On very important\nbusiness, Miss Fairfax states.\n\nCECILY.\nIsn\u2019t Mr. Worthing in his library?\n\nMERRIMAN.\nMr. Worthing went over in the direction of the Rectory some time ago.\n\nCECILY.\nPray ask the lady to come out here; Mr. Worthing is sure to be back\nsoon. And you can bring tea.\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, Miss. [Goes out.]\n\nCECILY.\nMiss Fairfax! I suppose one of the many good elderly women who are\nassociated with Uncle Jack in some of his philanthropic work in London.\nI don\u2019t quite like women who are interested in philanthropic work. I\nthink it is so forward of them.\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nMiss Fairfax.\n\n[Enter Gwendolen.]\n\n[Exit Merriman.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Advancing to meet her.] Pray let me introduce myself to you. My name\nis Cecily Cardew.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nCecily Cardew? [Moving to her and shaking hands.] What a very sweet\nname! Something tells me that we are going to be great friends. I like\nyou already more than I can say. My first impressions of people are\nnever wrong.\n\nCECILY.\nHow nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other such\na comparatively short time. Pray sit down.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Still standing up.] I may call you Cecily, may I not?\n\nCECILY.\nWith pleasure!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAnd you will always call me Gwendolen, won\u2019t you?\n\nCECILY.\nIf you wish.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThen that is all quite settled, is it not?\n\nCECILY.\nI hope so. [A pause. They both sit down together.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nPerhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my mentioning who I\nam. My father is Lord Bracknell. You have never heard of papa, I\nsuppose?\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think so.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nOutside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is entirely unknown.\nI think that is quite as it should be. The home seems to me to be the\nproper sphere for the man. And certainly once a man begins to neglect\nhis domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not? And I\ndon\u2019t like that. It makes men so very attractive. Cecily, mamma, whose\nviews on education are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be\nextremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my\nlooking at you through my glasses?\n\nCECILY.\nOh! not at all, Gwendolen. I am very fond of being looked at.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[After examining Cecily carefully through a lorgnette.] You are here on\na short visit, I suppose.\n\nCECILY.\nOh no! I live here.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Severely.] Really? Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of\nadvanced years, resides here also?\n\nCECILY.\nOh no! I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nIndeed?\n\nCECILY.\nMy dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has the arduous\ntask of looking after me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYour guardian?\n\nCECILY.\nYes, I am Mr. Worthing\u2019s ward.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nOh! It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a ward. How\nsecretive of him! He grows more interesting hourly. I am not sure,\nhowever, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight.\n[Rising and going to her.] I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked\nyou ever since I met you! But I am bound to state that now that I know\nthat you are Mr. Worthing\u2019s ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you\nwere\u2014well, just a little older than you seem to be\u2014and not quite so\nvery alluring in appearance. In fact, if I may speak candidly\u2014\n\nCECILY.\nPray do! I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one\nshould always be quite candid.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nWell, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you were fully\nforty-two, and more than usually plain for your age. Ernest has a\nstrong upright nature. He is the very soul of truth and honour.\nDisloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception. But even men of\nthe noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the\ninfluence of the physical charms of others. Modern, no less than\nAncient History, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I\nrefer to. If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.\n\nCECILY.\nI beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian. It is his\nbrother\u2014his elder brother.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Sitting down again.] Ernest never mentioned to me that he had a\nbrother.\n\nCECILY.\nI am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long time.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAh! that accounts for it. And now that I think of it I have never heard\nany man mention his brother. The subject seems distasteful to most men.\nCecily, you have lifted a load from my mind. I was growing almost\nanxious. It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a\nfriendship like ours, would it not? Of course you are quite, quite sure\nthat it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?\n\nCECILY.\nQuite sure. [A pause.] In fact, I am going to be his.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Inquiringly.] I beg your pardon?\n\nCECILY.\n[Rather shy and confidingly.] Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason why\nI should make a secret of it to you. Our little county newspaper is\nsure to chronicle the fact next week. Mr. Ernest Worthing and I are\nengaged to be married.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Quite politely, rising.] My darling Cecily, I think there must be some\nslight error. Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me. The announcement\nwill appear in the _Morning Post_ on Saturday at the latest.\n\nCECILY.\n[Very politely, rising.] I am afraid you must be under some\nmisconception. Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago. [Shows\ndiary.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.] It is certainly very\ncurious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30. If\nyou would care to verify the incident, pray do so. [Produces diary of\nher own.] I never travel without my diary. One should always have\nsomething sensational to read in the train. I am so sorry, dear Cecily,\nif it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior\nclaim.\n\nCECILY.\nIt would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen, if it\ncaused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to point\nout that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Meditatively.] If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish\npromise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a\nfirm hand.\n\nCECILY.\n[Thoughtfully and sadly.] Whatever unfortunate entanglement my dear boy\nmay have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we are\nmarried.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nDo you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement? You are\npresumptuous. On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral\nduty to speak one\u2019s mind. It becomes a pleasure.\n\nCECILY.\nDo you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an\nengagement? How dare you? This is no time for wearing the shallow mask\nof manners. When I see a spade I call it a spade.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Satirically.] I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade. It is\nobvious that our social spheres have been widely different.\n\n[Enter Merriman, followed by the footman. He carries a salver, table\ncloth, and plate stand. Cecily is about to retort. The presence of the\nservants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls\nchafe.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nShall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?\n\nCECILY.\n[Sternly, in a calm voice.] Yes, as usual. [Merriman begins to clear\ntable and lay cloth. A long pause. Cecily and Gwendolen glare at each\nother.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAre there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?\n\nCECILY.\nOh! yes! a great many. From the top of one of the hills quite close one\ncan see five counties.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nFive counties! I don\u2019t think I should like that; I hate crowds.\n\nCECILY.\n[Sweetly.] I suppose that is why you live in town? [Gwendolen bites her\nlip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Looking round.] Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.\n\nCECILY.\nSo glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI had no idea there were any flowers in the country.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in London.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nPersonally I cannot understand how anybody manages to exist in the\ncountry, if anybody who is anybody does. The country always bores me to\ndeath.\n\nCECILY.\nAh! This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression, is it\nnot? I believe the aristocracy are suffering very much from it just at\npresent. It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have been told. May I\noffer you some tea, Miss Fairfax?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[With elaborate politeness.] Thank you. [Aside.] Detestable girl! But I\nrequire tea!\n\nCECILY.\n[Sweetly.] Sugar?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Superciliously.] No, thank you. Sugar is not fashionable any more.\n[Cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of\nsugar into the cup.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Severely.] Cake or bread and butter?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[In a bored manner.] Bread and butter, please. Cake is rarely seen at\nthe best houses nowadays.\n\nCECILY.\n[Cuts a very large slice of cake, and puts it on the tray.] Hand that\nto Miss Fairfax.\n\n[Merriman does so, and goes out with footman. Gwendolen drinks the tea\nand makes a grimace. Puts down cup at once, reaches out her hand to the\nbread and butter, looks at it, and finds it is cake. Rises in\nindignation.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYou have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I asked most\ndistinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake. I am known for\nthe gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness of my\nnature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.\n\nCECILY.\n[Rising.] To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the machinations\nof any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not go.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nFrom the moment I saw you I distrusted you. I felt that you were false\nand deceitful. I am never deceived in such matters. My first\nimpressions of people are invariably right.\n\nCECILY.\nIt seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on your valuable\ntime. No doubt you have many other calls of a similar character to make\nin the neighbourhood.\n\n[Enter Jack.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Catching sight of him.] Ernest! My own Ernest!\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen! Darling! [Offers to kiss her.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Draws back.] A moment! May I ask if you are engaged to be married to\nthis young lady? [Points to Cecily.]\n\nJACK.\n[Laughing.] To dear little Cecily! Of course not! What could have put\nsuch an idea into your pretty little head?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThank you. You may! [Offers her cheek.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Very sweetly.] I knew there must be some misunderstanding, Miss\nFairfax. The gentleman whose arm is at present round your waist is my\nguardian, Mr. John Worthing.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI beg your pardon?\n\nCECILY.\nThis is Uncle Jack.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Receding.] Jack! Oh!\n\n[Enter Algernon.]\n\nCECILY.\nHere is Ernest.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Goes straight over to Cecily without noticing any one else.] My own\nlove! [Offers to kiss her.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Drawing back.] A moment, Ernest! May I ask you\u2014are you engaged to be\nmarried to this young lady?\n\nALGERNON.\n[Looking round.] To what young lady? Good heavens! Gwendolen!\n\nCECILY.\nYes! to good heavens, Gwendolen, I mean to Gwendolen.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Laughing.] Of course not! What could have put such an idea into your\npretty little head?\n\nCECILY.\nThank you. [Presenting her cheek to be kissed.] You may. [Algernon\nkisses her.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI felt there was some slight error, Miss Cardew. The gentleman who is\nnow embracing you is my cousin, Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.\n\nCECILY.\n[Breaking away from Algernon.] Algernon Moncrieff! Oh! [The two girls\nmove towards each other and put their arms round each other\u2019s waists as\nif for protection.]\n\nCECILY.\nAre you called Algernon?\n\nALGERNON.\nI cannot deny it.\n\nCECILY.\nOh!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nIs your name really John?\n\nJACK.\n[Standing rather proudly.] I could deny it if I liked. I could deny\nanything if I liked. But my name certainly is John. It has been John\nfor years.\n\nCECILY.\n[To Gwendolen.] A gross deception has been practised on both of us.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMy poor wounded Cecily!\n\nCECILY.\nMy sweet wronged Gwendolen!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Slowly and seriously.] You will call me sister, will you not? [They\nembrace. Jack and Algernon groan and walk up and down.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Rather brightly.] There is just one question I would like to be\nallowed to ask my guardian.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAn admirable idea! Mr. Worthing, there is just one question I would\nlike to be permitted to put to you. Where is your brother Ernest? We\nare both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so it is a\nmatter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest is at\npresent.\n\nJACK.\n[Slowly and hesitatingly.] Gwendolen\u2014Cecily\u2014it is very painful for me\nto be forced to speak the truth. It is the first time in my life that I\nhave ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really\nquite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind. However, I will tell\nyou quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest. I have no brother at\nall. I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the\nsmallest intention of ever having one in the future.\n\nCECILY.\n[Surprised.] No brother at all?\n\nJACK.\n[Cheerily.] None!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Severely.] Had you never a brother of any kind?\n\nJACK.\n[Pleasantly.] Never. Not even of any kind.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of us is engaged to\nbe married to any one.\n\nCECILY.\nIt is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find\nherself in. Is it?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nLet us go into the house. They will hardly venture to come after us\nthere.\n\nCECILY.\nNo, men are so cowardly, aren\u2019t they?\n\n[They retire into the house with scornful looks.]\n\nJACK.\nThis ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying, I suppose?\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is. The most wonderful\nBunbury I have ever had in my life.\n\nJACK.\nWell, you\u2019ve no right whatsoever to Bunbury here.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is absurd. One has a right to Bunbury anywhere one chooses. Every\nserious Bunburyist knows that.\n\nJACK.\nSerious Bunburyist! Good heavens!\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, one must be serious about something, if one wants to have any\namusement in life. I happen to be serious about Bunburying. What on\nearth you are serious about I haven\u2019t got the remotest idea. About\neverything, I should fancy. You have such an absolutely trivial nature.\n\nJACK.\nWell, the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of this wretched\nbusiness is that your friend Bunbury is quite exploded. You won\u2019t be\nable to run down to the country quite so often as you used to do, dear\nAlgy. And a very good thing too.\n\nALGERNON.\nYour brother is a little off colour, isn\u2019t he, dear Jack? You won\u2019t be\nable to disappear to London quite so frequently as your wicked custom\nwas. And not a bad thing either.\n\nJACK.\nAs for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I must say that your taking in\na sweet, simple, innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable. To say\nnothing of the fact that she is my ward.\n\nALGERNON.\nI can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a brilliant,\nclever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax. To say\nnothing of the fact that she is my cousin.\n\nJACK.\nI wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all. I love her.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily. I adore her.\n\nJACK.\nThere is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.\n\nALGERNON.\nI don\u2019t think there is much likelihood, Jack, of you and Miss Fairfax\nbeing united.\n\nJACK.\nWell, that is no business of yours.\n\nALGERNON.\nIf it was my business, I wouldn\u2019t talk about it. [Begins to eat\nmuffins.] It is very vulgar to talk about one\u2019s business. Only people\nlike stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties.\n\nJACK.\nHow can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this\nhorrible trouble, I can\u2019t make out. You seem to me to be perfectly\nheartless.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I can\u2019t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter would\nprobably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins quite calmly.\nIt is the only way to eat them.\n\nJACK.\nI say it\u2019s perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the\ncircumstances.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhen I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles me.\nIndeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me\nintimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink. At\nthe present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy. Besides, I\nam particularly fond of muffins. [Rising.]\n\nJACK.\n[Rising.] Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in that\ngreedy way. [Takes muffins from Algernon.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[Offering tea-cake.] I wish you would have tea-cake instead. I don\u2019t\nlike tea-cake.\n\nJACK.\nGood heavens! I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own\ngarden.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat muffins.\n\nJACK.\nI said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances. That\nis a very different thing.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat may be. But the muffins are the same. [He seizes the muffin-dish\nfrom Jack.]\n\nJACK.\nAlgy, I wish to goodness you would go.\n\nALGERNON.\nYou can\u2019t possibly ask me to go without having some dinner. It\u2019s\nabsurd. I never go without my dinner. No one ever does, except\nvegetarians and people like that. Besides I have just made arrangements\nwith Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name\nof Ernest.\n\nJACK.\nMy dear fellow, the sooner you give up that nonsense the better. I made\narrangements this morning with Dr. Chasuble to be christened myself at\n5.30, and I naturally will take the name of Ernest. Gwendolen would\nwish it. We can\u2019t both be christened Ernest. It\u2019s absurd. Besides, I\nhave a perfect right to be christened if I like. There is no evidence\nat all that I have ever been christened by anybody. I should think it\nextremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble. It is\nentirely different in your case. You have been christened already.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, but I have not been christened for years.\n\nJACK.\nYes, but you have been christened. That is the important thing.\n\nALGERNON.\nQuite so. So I know my constitution can stand it. If you are not quite\nsure about your ever having been christened, I must say I think it\nrather dangerous your venturing on it now. It might make you very\nunwell. You can hardly have forgotten that some one very closely\nconnected with you was very nearly carried off this week in Paris by a\nsevere chill.\n\nJACK.\nYes, but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary.\n\nALGERNON.\nIt usen\u2019t to be, I know\u2014but I daresay it is now. Science is always\nmaking wonderful improvements in things.\n\nJACK.\n[Picking up the muffin-dish.] Oh, that is nonsense; you are always\ntalking nonsense.\n\nALGERNON.\nJack, you are at the muffins again! I wish you wouldn\u2019t. There are only\ntwo left. [Takes them.] I told you I was particularly fond of muffins.\n\nJACK.\nBut I hate tea-cake.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhy on earth then do you allow tea-cake to be served up for your\nguests? What ideas you have of hospitality!\n\nJACK.\nAlgernon! I have already told you to go. I don\u2019t want you here. Why\ndon\u2019t you go!\n\nALGERNON.\nI haven\u2019t quite finished my tea yet! and there is still one muffin\nleft. [Jack groans, and sinks into a chair. Algernon still continues\neating.]\n\nACT DROP\n\n\n\n\nTHIRD ACT\n\nSCENE\n\nMorning-room at the Manor House.\n\n[Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window, looking out into the garden.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThe fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one\nelse would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of\nshame left.\n\nCECILY.\nThey have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[After a pause.] They don\u2019t seem to notice us at all. Couldn\u2019t you\ncough?\n\nCECILY.\nBut I haven\u2019t got a cough.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThey\u2019re looking at us. What effrontery!\n\nCECILY.\nThey\u2019re approaching. That\u2019s very forward of them.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nLet us preserve a dignified silence.\n\nCECILY.\nCertainly. It\u2019s the only thing to do now. [Enter Jack followed by\nAlgernon. They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThis dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.\n\nCECILY.\nA most distasteful one.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nBut we will not be the first to speak.\n\nCECILY.\nCertainly not.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends\non your reply.\n\nCECILY.\nGwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly\nanswer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my\nguardian\u2019s brother?\n\nALGERNON.\nIn order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.\n\nCECILY.\n[To Gwendolen.] That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does\nit not?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, dear, if you can believe him.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nTrue. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital\nthing. Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for\npretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an\nopportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?\n\nJACK.\nCan you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI have the gravest doubts upon the subject. But I intend to crush them.\nThis is not the moment for German scepticism. [Moving to Cecily.] Their\nexplanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially Mr.\nWorthing\u2019s. That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.\n\nCECILY.\nI am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said. His voice alone\ninspires one with absolute credulity.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThen you think we should forgive them?\n\nCECILY.\nYes. I mean no.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nTrue! I had forgotten. There are principles at stake that one cannot\nsurrender. Which of us should tell them? The task is not a pleasant\none.\n\nCECILY.\nCould we not both speak at the same time?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAn excellent idea! I nearly always speak at the same time as other\npeople. Will you take the time from me?\n\nCECILY.\nCertainly. [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]\n\nGWENDOLEN and CECILY [Speaking together.] Your Christian names are\nstill an insuperable barrier. That is all!\n\nJACK and ALGERNON [Speaking together.] Our Christian names! Is that\nall? But we are going to be christened this afternoon.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[To Jack.] For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing?\n\nJACK.\nI am.\n\nCECILY.\n[To Algernon.] To please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal?\n\nALGERNON.\nI am!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nHow absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes! Where questions of\nself-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.\n\nJACK.\nWe are. [Clasps hands with Algernon.]\n\nCECILY.\nThey have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely\nnothing.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[To Jack.] Darling!\n\nALGERNON.\n[To Cecily.] Darling! [They fall into each other\u2019s arms.]\n\n[Enter Merriman. When he enters he coughs loudly, seeing the\nsituation.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nAhem! Ahem! Lady Bracknell!\n\nJACK.\nGood heavens!\n\n[Enter Lady Bracknell. The couples separate in alarm. Exit Merriman.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nGwendolen! What does this mean?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMerely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing, mamma.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nCome here. Sit down. Sit down immediately. Hesitation of any kind is a\nsign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness in the old.\n[Turns to Jack.] Apprised, sir, of my daughter\u2019s sudden flight by her\ntrusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of a small coin, I\nfollowed her at once by a luggage train. Her unhappy father is, I am\nglad to say, under the impression that she is attending a more than\nusually lengthy lecture by the University Extension Scheme on the\nInfluence of a permanent income on Thought. I do not propose to\nundeceive him. Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question. I\nwould consider it wrong. But of course, you will clearly understand\nthat all communication between yourself and my daughter must cease\nimmediately from this moment. On this point, as indeed on all points, I\nam firm.\n\nJACK.\nI am engaged to be married to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell!\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nYou are nothing of the kind, sir. And now, as regards Algernon! . . .\nAlgernon!\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMay I ask if it is in this house that your invalid friend Mr. Bunbury\nresides?\n\nALGERNON.\n[Stammering.] Oh! No! Bunbury doesn\u2019t live here. Bunbury is somewhere\nelse at present. In fact, Bunbury is dead.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nDead! When did Mr. Bunbury die? His death must have been extremely\nsudden.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Airily.] Oh! I killed Bunbury this afternoon. I mean poor Bunbury died\nthis afternoon.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nWhat did he die of?\n\nALGERNON.\nBunbury? Oh, he was quite exploded.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nExploded! Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage? I was not aware\nthat Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation. If so, he is\nwell punished for his morbidity.\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out! The doctors found out\nthat Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean\u2014so Bunbury died.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nHe seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.\nI am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some\ndefinite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice. And\nnow that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr.\nWorthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now\nholding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?\n\nJACK.\nThat lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward. [Lady Bracknell bows coldly\nto Cecily.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI beg your pardon?\n\nCECILY.\nMr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.] I do not know\nwhether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of this\nparticular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that go\non seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics\nhave laid down for our guidance. I think some preliminary inquiry on my\npart would not be out of place. Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all\nconnected with any of the larger railway stations in London? I merely\ndesire information. Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any\nfamilies or persons whose origin was a Terminus. [Jack looks perfectly\nfurious, but restrains himself.]\n\nJACK.\n[In a clear, cold voice.] Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of the late\nMr. Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park, Dorking,\nSurrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat sounds not unsatisfactory. Three addresses always inspire\nconfidence, even in tradesmen. But what proof have I of their\nauthenticity?\n\nJACK.\nI have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period. They are\nopen to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Grimly.] I have known strange errors in that publication.\n\nJACK.\nMiss Cardew\u2019s family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and Markby.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMarkby, Markby, and Markby? A firm of the very highest position in\ntheir profession. Indeed I am told that one of the Mr. Markby\u2019s is\noccasionally to be seen at dinner parties. So far I am satisfied.\n\nJACK.\n[Very irritably.] How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell! I have\nalso in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of\nMiss Cardew\u2019s birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration,\nvaccination, confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the\nEnglish variety.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nAh! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps somewhat too\nexciting for a young girl. I am not myself in favour of premature\nexperiences. [Rises, looks at her watch.] Gwendolen! the time\napproaches for our departure. We have not a moment to lose. As a matter\nof form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any\nlittle fortune?\n\nJACK.\nOh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds. That is\nall. Goodbye, Lady Bracknell. So pleased to have seen you.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Sitting down again.] A moment, Mr. Worthing. A hundred and thirty\nthousand pounds! And in the Funds! Miss Cardew seems to me a most\nattractive young lady, now that I look at her. Few girls of the present\nday have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last,\nand improve with time. We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces.\n[To Cecily.] Come over here, dear. [Cecily goes across.] Pretty child!\nyour dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might\nhave left it. But we can soon alter all that. A thoroughly experienced\nFrench maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space\nof time. I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing, and after\nthree months her own husband did not know her.\n\nJACK.\nAnd after six months nobody knew her.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Glares at Jack for a few moments. Then bends, with a practised smile,\nto Cecily.] Kindly turn round, sweet child. [Cecily turns completely\nround.] No, the side view is what I want. [Cecily presents her\nprofile.] Yes, quite as I expected. There are distinct social\npossibilities in your profile. The two weak points in our age are its\nwant of principle and its want of profile. The chin a little higher,\ndear. Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn. They are worn\nvery high, just at present. Algernon!\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, Aunt Augusta!\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThere are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew\u2019s profile.\n\nALGERNON.\nCecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole world. And\nI don\u2019t care twopence about social possibilities.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nNever speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon. Only people who can\u2019t\nget into it do that. [To Cecily.] Dear child, of course you know that\nAlgernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon. But I do not approve\nof mercenary marriages. When I married Lord Bracknell I had no fortune\nof any kind. But I never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand\nin my way. Well, I suppose I must give my consent.\n\nALGERNON.\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nCecily, you may kiss me!\n\nCECILY.\n[Kisses her.] Thank you, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nYou may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.\n\nCECILY.\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.\n\nALGERNON.\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nCECILY.\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nTo speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements. They give\npeople the opportunity of finding out each other\u2019s character before\nmarriage, which I think is never advisable.\n\nJACK.\nI beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this\nengagement is quite out of the question. I am Miss Cardew\u2019s guardian,\nand she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age. That\nconsent I absolutely decline to give.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nUpon what grounds may I ask? Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say\nan ostentatiously, eligible young man. He has nothing, but he looks\neverything. What more can one desire?\n\nJACK.\nIt pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell,\nabout your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his\nmoral character. I suspect him of being untruthful. [Algernon and\nCecily look at him in indignant amazement.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nUntruthful! My nephew Algernon? Impossible! He is an Oxonian.\n\nJACK.\nI fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter. This afternoon\nduring my temporary absence in London on an important question of\nromance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false\npretence of being my brother. Under an assumed name he drank, I\u2019ve just\nbeen informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet,\nBrut, \u201989; wine I was specially reserving for myself. Continuing his\ndisgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in\nalienating the affections of my only ward. He subsequently stayed to\ntea, and devoured every single muffin. And what makes his conduct all\nthe more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first\nthat I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don\u2019t\nintend to have a brother, not even of any kind. I distinctly told him\nso myself yesterday afternoon.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nAhem! Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided entirely\nto overlook my nephew\u2019s conduct to you.\n\nJACK.\nThat is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell. My own decision, however,\nis unalterable. I decline to give my consent.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[To Cecily.] Come here, sweet child. [Cecily goes over.] How old are\nyou, dear?\n\nCECILY.\nWell, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty when I go\nto evening parties.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nYou are perfectly right in making some slight alteration. Indeed, no\nwoman should ever be quite accurate about her age. It looks so\ncalculating . . . [In a meditative manner.] Eighteen, but admitting to\ntwenty at evening parties. Well, it will not be very long before you\nare of age and free from the restraints of tutelage. So I don\u2019t think\nyour guardian\u2019s consent is, after all, a matter of any importance.\n\nJACK.\nPray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it is\nonly fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather\u2019s\nwill Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat does not seem to me to be a grave objection. Thirty-five is a very\nattractive age. London society is full of women of the very highest\nbirth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for\nyears. Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point. To my own knowledge she\nhas been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty, which\nwas many years ago now. I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not\nbe even still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at\npresent. There will be a large accumulation of property.\n\nCECILY.\nAlgy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?\n\nALGERNON.\nOf course I could, Cecily. You know I could.\n\nCECILY.\nYes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn\u2019t wait all that time. I hate\nwaiting even five minutes for anybody. It always makes me rather cross.\nI am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others,\nand waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.\n\nALGERNON.\nThen what is to be done, Cecily?\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t know, Mr. Moncrieff.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMy dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively that she cannot\nwait till she is thirty-five\u2014a remark which I am bound to say seems to\nme to show a somewhat impatient nature\u2014I would beg of you to reconsider\nyour decision.\n\nJACK.\nBut my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own hands.\nThe moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will most\ngladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Rising and drawing herself up.] You must be quite aware that what you\npropose is out of the question.\n\nJACK.\nThen a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen. Algernon, of course,\ncan choose for himself. [Pulls out her watch.] Come, dear, [Gwendolen\nrises] we have already missed five, if not six, trains. To miss any\nmore might expose us to comment on the platform.\n\n[Enter Dr. Chasuble.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nEverything is quite ready for the christenings.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe christenings, sir! Is not that somewhat premature?\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.] Both these\ngentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nAt their age? The idea is grotesque and irreligious! Algernon, I forbid\nyou to be baptized. I will not hear of such excesses. Lord Bracknell\nwould be highly displeased if he learned that that was the way in which\nyou wasted your time and money.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAm I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all\nthis afternoon?\n\nJACK.\nI don\u2019t think that, as things are now, it would be of much practical\nvalue to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nI am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing. They\nsavour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have\ncompletely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons. However, as your\npresent mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the\nchurch at once. Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener\nthat for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in\nthe vestry.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Starting.] Miss Prism! Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYes, Lady Bracknell. I am on my way to join her.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nPray allow me to detain you for a moment. This matter may prove to be\none of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself. Is this Miss\nPrism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education?\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Somewhat indignantly.] She is the most cultivated of ladies, and the\nvery picture of respectability.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIt is obviously the same person. May I ask what position she holds in\nyour household?\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Severely.] I am a celibate, madam.\n\nJACK.\n[Interposing.] Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three\nyears Miss Cardew\u2019s esteemed governess and valued companion.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIn spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once. Let her be sent\nfor.\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Looking off.] She approaches; she is nigh.\n\n[Enter Miss Prism hurriedly.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\nI was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon. I have been\nwaiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters. [Catches sight of\nLady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare. Miss Prism grows\npale and quails. She looks anxiously round as if desirous to escape.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[In a severe, judicial voice.] Prism! [Miss Prism bows her head in\nshame.] Come here, Prism! [Miss Prism approaches in a humble manner.]\nPrism! Where is that baby? [General consternation. The Canon starts\nback in horror. Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to shield\nCecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible public\nscandal.] Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell\u2019s\nhouse, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator\nthat contained a baby of the male sex. You never returned. A few weeks\nlater, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police,\nthe perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a\nremote corner of Bayswater. It contained the manuscript of a\nthree-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality. [Miss\nPrism starts in involuntary indignation.] But the baby was not there!\n[Every one looks at Miss Prism.] Prism! Where is that baby? [A pause.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\nLady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know. I only wish I\ndid. The plain facts of the case are these. On the morning of the day\nyou mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared as\nusual to take the baby out in its perambulator. I had also with me a\nsomewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place\nthe manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few\nunoccupied hours. In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never\ncan forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and\nplaced the baby in the hand-bag.\n\nJACK.\n[Who has been listening attentively.] But where did you deposit the\nhand-bag?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nDo not ask me, Mr. Worthing.\n\nJACK.\nMiss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me. I insist on\nknowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that infant.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nI left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway stations in\nLondon.\n\nJACK.\nWhat railway station?\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Quite crushed.] Victoria. The Brighton line. [Sinks into a chair.]\n\nJACK.\nI must retire to my room for a moment. Gwendolen, wait here for me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nIf you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life. [Exit\nJack in great excitement.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nWhat do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble. I need hardly tell you that in\nfamilies of high position strange coincidences are not supposed to\noccur. They are hardly considered the thing.\n\n[Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about. Every\none looks up.]\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack seems strangely agitated.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYour guardian has a very emotional nature.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThis noise is extremely unpleasant. It sounds as if he was having an\nargument. I dislike arguments of any kind. They are always vulgar, and\noften convincing.\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Looking up.] It has stopped now. [The noise is redoubled.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI wish he would arrive at some conclusion.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThis suspense is terrible. I hope it will last. [Enter Jack with a\nhand-bag of black leather in his hand.]\n\nJACK.\n[Rushing over to Miss Prism.] Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism? Examine\nit carefully before you speak. The happiness of more than one life\ndepends on your answer.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Calmly.] It seems to be mine. Yes, here is the injury it received\nthrough the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier\ndays. Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a\ntemperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington. And here,\non the lock, are my initials. I had forgotten that in an extravagant\nmood I had had them placed there. The bag is undoubtedly mine. I am\ndelighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me. It has been a\ngreat inconvenience being without it all these years.\n\nJACK.\n[In a pathetic voice.] Miss Prism, more is restored to you than this\nhand-bag. I was the baby you placed in it.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Amazed.] You?\n\nJACK.\n[Embracing her.] Yes . . . mother!\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Recoiling in indignant astonishment.] Mr. Worthing! I am unmarried!\n\nJACK.\nUnmarried! I do not deny that is a serious blow. But after all, who has\nthe right to cast a stone against one who has suffered? Cannot\nrepentance wipe out an act of folly? Why should there be one law for\nmen, and another for women? Mother, I forgive you. [Tries to embrace\nher again.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Still more indignant.] Mr. Worthing, there is some error. [Pointing to\nLady Bracknell.] There is the lady who can tell you who you really are.\n\nJACK.\n[After a pause.] Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but would\nyou kindly inform me who I am?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI am afraid that the news I have to give you will not altogether please\nyou. You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and\nconsequently Algernon\u2019s elder brother.\n\nJACK.\nAlgy\u2019s elder brother! Then I have a brother after all. I knew I had a\nbrother! I always said I had a brother! Cecily,\u2014how could you have ever\ndoubted that I had a brother? [Seizes hold of Algernon.] Dr. Chasuble,\nmy unfortunate brother. Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother. Gwendolen,\nmy unfortunate brother. Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to\ntreat me with more respect in the future. You have never behaved to me\nlike a brother in all your life.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, not till to-day, old boy, I admit. I did my best, however, though\nI was out of practice.\n\n[Shakes hands.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[To Jack.] My own! But what own are you? What is your Christian name,\nnow that you have become some one else?\n\nJACK.\nGood heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten that point. Your decision on\nthe subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI never change, except in my affections.\n\nCECILY.\nWhat a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!\n\nJACK.\nThen the question had better be cleared up at once. Aunt Augusta, a\nmoment. At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I been\nchristened already?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nEvery luxury that money could buy, including christening, had been\nlavished on you by your fond and doting parents.\n\nJACK.\nThen I was christened! That is settled. Now, what name was I given? Let\nme know the worst.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nBeing the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father.\n\nJACK.\n[Irritably.] Yes, but what was my father\u2019s Christian name?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Meditatively.] I cannot at the present moment recall what the\nGeneral\u2019s Christian name was. But I have no doubt he had one. He was\neccentric, I admit. But only in later years. And that was the result of\nthe Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of\nthat kind.\n\nJACK.\nAlgy! Can\u2019t you recollect what our father\u2019s Christian name was?\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms. He died before I was\na year old.\n\nJACK.\nHis name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose, Aunt\nAugusta?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe General was essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic\nlife. But I have no doubt his name would appear in any military\ndirectory.\n\nJACK.\nThe Army Lists of the last forty years are here. These delightful\nrecords should have been my constant study. [Rushes to bookcase and\ntears the books out.] M. Generals . . . Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what\nghastly names they have\u2014Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff! Lieutenant\n1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869, Christian\nnames, Ernest John. [Puts book very quietly down and speaks quite\ncalmly.] I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn\u2019t I?\nWell, it is Ernest after all. I mean it naturally is Ernest.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nYes, I remember now that the General was called Ernest, I knew I had\nsome particular reason for disliking the name.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nErnest! My own Ernest! I felt from the first that you could have no\nother name!\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that\nall his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth. Can you\nforgive me?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI can. For I feel that you are sure to change.\n\nJACK.\nMy own one!\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[To Miss Prism.] L\xe6titia! [Embraces her]\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Enthusiastically.] Frederick! At last!\n\nALGERNON.\nCecily! [Embraces her.] At last!\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen! [Embraces her.] At last!\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMy nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality.\n\nJACK.\nOn the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I\u2019ve now realised for the first time in\nmy life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.\n\nTABLEAU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST: A TRIVIAL COMEDY FOR SERIOUS PEOPLE ***\n\n\n    \n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n".split(/\. |\? /),Md=(e,n)=>`${e}-${n}`;const
